# 竞赛题 29
Zoltan has a list of whole numbers, all larger than 0 but smaller than 1000. He notices that every number in his list is either one-third of another number in the list or three times another number in the list. What is the largest number of different whole numbers that can be on Zoltan's list?

## 1. 解题思路
- Observe that if a number is larger than 333 and not a multiple of 3, then it cannot be on the list.
- On the other hand, it is possible for all of the remaining whole numbers larger than O but smaller than 1000 to be on the list.
- Consequently Zoltan's list is largest when it contains all of the whole numbers from 1 to 333 as well as all of the multiples of 3 from 334 to 999. There are 33 numbers of the first type and 22 numbers of the second type, making 555 numbers in total.

## 2. 编写 Python 程序求解
```python
# 定义一个函数，用来判断一个数是否能被3整除
def is_divisible_by_3(num):
    flag = False
    if num % 3 == 0:
      flag = True
    return flag

# 定义一个函数，用来判断一个数是否能被3整除
def is_divisible_by_3(num):
    flag = False
    if num % 3 == 0:
      flag = True
    return flag

while x > 0 and x < 1000 :
    if is_prime(x) :
        #print("x=",x)
        y = 2 # 重新初始化 y
        while y > 1 and y < 50 :
            if is_prime(y) and is_prime(x+y) :
                #print("y=",y)
                z = 2 # 重新初始化 z
                while z > 1 and z < 50 and y != z :
                    if is_prime(z) and is_prime(x+z) and is_prime(234+z) and is_prime(234-z) :
                        # print("z=",z)
                        w = 2 # 重新初始化 w
                        while w > 1 and w < 300 :
                            if is_prime(w) :                  
                                if w + x + y == 234 :
                                    print("x=",x)
                                    print("y=",y)
                                    print("z=",z)
                                    print("w=",w)
                                    print("w-y=",w-y)                                    
                            w += 1
                    z += 1
            y += 1
    x += 1
```
