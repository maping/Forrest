Zoltan has a list of whole numbers, all larger than 0 but smaller than 1000. He notices that every number in his list is either one-third of another number in the list or three times another number in the list. What is the largest number of different whole numbers that can be on Zoltan's list?

## 1. 解题思路
- Observe that if a number is larger than 333 and not a multiple of 3, then it cannot be on the list.
- On the other hand, it is possible for all of the remaining whole numbers larger than O but smaller than 1000 to be on the list.
- Consequently Zoltan's list is largest when it contains all of the whole numbers from 1 to 333 as well as all of the multiples of 3 from 334 to 999. There are 333 numbers of the first type and 222 numbers of the second type, making 555 numbers in total.

333 +（333-111）= 555
