## 答题
- Where does the speaker encounter the daffodils? 
  - According to the poem, the speaker encounters the daffodils beside a lake and beneath trees. Specifically, the fifth line of the poem states: "Beside the lake, beneath the trees," describing the location where the speaker comes across the crowd of golden daffodils. This setting creates a picturesque natural scene, with the daffodils flourishing near a body of water and under the canopy of trees, enhancing the vivid imagery of the poem.
- Which two literary devices are being used in this poem？
  - In the poem "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" by William Wordsworth, two prominent literary devices are:
Simile: The speaker compares themselves to a cloud, using the word "as" in the line "I wandered lonely as a cloud." This simile sets the tone for the poem and emphasizes the speaker's sense of solitude.
Personification: The daffodils are given human-like qualities, described as "fluttering and dancing in the breeze." This personification brings the scene to life and conveys the joy and energy of the natural world.
- How does the speaker describe the movement of the daffodils?
  - The speaker describes the movement of the daffodils as "fluttering and dancing in the breeze." This imagery conveys a sense of liveliness and grace, suggesting that the daffodils move in harmony with the natural elements around them. Additionally, they are said to be "tossing their heads in sprightly dance," further emphasizing their joyful and animated presence.
- What effect do the daffodils have on the speaker's mood? How do you know?
  - The daffodils have a profound positive effect on the speaker's mood. Initially, the speaker describes feeling lonely, but the sight of the daffodils brings joy and a sense of companionship. The speaker notes that "a poet could not but be gay, in such a jocund company," indicating that the daffodils lift their spirits. Later, when the speaker is in a "vacant or in pensive mood," the memory of the daffodils flashes upon their "inward eye" and fills their heart with pleasure, allowing them to "dance with the daffodils." This transformation shows the lasting impact of the daffodils on the speaker's emotional state.
- What does "jocound company" mean?
  - In the poem, "jocund company" refers to the cheerful and light-hearted presence of the daffodils. The word "jocund" means merry or joyful, and the daffodils' lively dance in the breeze provides the speaker with a sense of happiness and companionship
- What does the phrase "continuous as the stars that shine" suggest about the number of daffodils?
  - The phrase "continuous as the stars that shine" suggests that the number of daffodils is vast and seemingly endless. Wordsworth uses this simile to compare the daffodils to the countless stars in the Milky Way, emphasizing their abundance and the impression of an infinite line of flowers stretching along the bay
- How does the poet convey the idea of solitude in the first stanza?
  - In the first stanza of "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," the poet conveys the idea of solitude through the simile "I wandered lonely as a cloud." This comparison suggests the speaker's isolation, as a cloud floats alone in the sky, detached from the world below. The imagery of "vales and hills" further emphasizes the vastness of the landscape, highlighting the speaker's solitary presence amidst nature.
- What is the significance of the image of the waves in the poem?
  - In the poem "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud," the image of the waves is significant because it highlights the daffodils' beauty and liveliness. The speaker notes that the waves beside the daffodils also danced, but the daffodils "out-did the sparkling waves in glee." This comparison emphasizes the daffodils' vibrant and joyful movement, suggesting that their beauty surpasses even the natural elegance of the waves. The daffodils' ability to outshine the waves enhances their impact on the speaker, contributing to the overall theme of nature's uplifting power.
