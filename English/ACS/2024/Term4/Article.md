You have heard about a school that allows the students to bring their mobile phones to classes. You have decided to write an article giving your views about this idea **for your school magazine**. Here are two comments from other young people: 
- Having my phone with me would help with research and quick access to information during lessons. 
- It could be distracting. Students might be tempted to check social media or play games during class. 

Write an article for your school magazine, giving your views. 
- The comments above may give you some ideas, and **you can also use some ideas of your own**.
- Your article should be between 120 and 160 words long.

You will receive up to 6 marks for the content of your article, and up to 9 marks for the language used.
