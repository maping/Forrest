# Have students in ACS studied with their devices properly?

The topic of whether students at ACS are properly studying with their devices has sparked a lively debate.While some students can study more efficiently with their devices, others may have their performance worsen.

On one hand, many people believe that ACS students are properly using their devices to get more knowledge. For example, by using Safari and Google,students can find the accurate information they want by searching for keywords. Zoom allows students from different regions to collaborate and complete a project together. 

However,some students who perform worse when using digital devices do so because they canâ€™t control themselves from watch YouTube,TikTok, and Instagram. Some students even became addicted to gaming. The use of phones or digital devices can also lead to cyberbullying. Recently, a sordid incident happend: A student bullied people by secretly taking photo of another student,and put some inappropriate words and pictures on the victim's photo and sent it to public. ACS has zero tolerance for this behavior.

In conclusion, while some ACS students can learn more efficiently by using devices for studying, those who cannot control themselves tend to get distracted.
