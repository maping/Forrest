  - Part I
    - 1. What is the applicant's experience of dealing with academic and social pressure in a fast-paced learning environment?
      - I handle pressure by playing sports to release stress and listening to music to relax and stay focused.
      - 马平的建议回答：I use two primary tools to handle pressure. Playing a fast-paced sport like basketball allows me to channel that nervous energy into something positive and collaborative. Alternatively, listening to music provides a different kind of space for relaxing and mental organization.
  
    - 2. How does the applicant feel about the move to UWCSEA?
      - I feel excited and motivated about moving to UWCSEA. It’s a great opportunity to learn, grow, and meet people from different backgrounds.
      - 马平的建议回答：The idea of living and learning with students from over 70 nationalities is incredible. I am motivated by the chance to be both a learner and a contributor. I hope to share my own culture while actively listening to others, and I can't imagine a more powerful environment for that kind of mutual exchange than UWCSEA.
  
    - 3. Has the applicant received any award or special recognition that you would like us to be aware of?Please provide details.
      - SASMO Gold prize,as a significant play to get first in 14u Rugby 2024-2025 Season 2
      - 马平的建议回答：Yes, I have been fortunate to receive recognition in both academic and sporting fields, which I believe reflect my balanced approach to learning and life. SASMO (Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad 2025) Grade 8 Gold Award: Winning the Gold Award was a validating moment that deepened my passion for mathematics and showed me the reward of sustained intellectual curiosity. Rugby Championship (2024-25 Season 2) : Being a 'significant player' meant I had to understand my teammates' strengths, make split-second decisions under pressure, and consistently support them on the field. Rugby has taught me the profound importance of trust, communication, and resilience. 
     
    - 4. Do you have any reservations about the applicant participating in College expeditions or in the social service programme?
      - I don’t have any reservations. I believe I can handle the challenges and will get the first 30 universities of the world in America or in the UK.
      - 马平的建议回答：These programmes are a primary reason for my application. I see expeditions and service not as separate activities, but as the practical application of what we learn in the classroom. I am eager to apply my energy and teamwork skills to these challenges. I see them as invaluable opportunities for personal growth and the best way to live out the UWC values in a practical, meaningful way.
  
    - 5. Interest/Activity details
      - I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and swimming because they keep me active, improve my focus, and teach me teamwork and discipline. I also love listening to music in my free time—it helps me relax, clear my mind, and stay motivated, especially during busy school days.
      - 马平的建议回答：Basketball and swimming are my physical and social outlets; one teaches me strategic communication and resilience in the face of a loss, while the other builds the solitary discipline to push through one more lap. Meanwhile, besides making me relax, music fuels my creativity and gives me a shared language to connect with others.

   - Part II
     - 1. Reflecting on your child's and your family's journey, what aspects of UWCSEA might help your child continue to grow and flourish?
       - 马平的建议回答：First，our child will thrive through UWCSEA’s commitment to experiential education, which includes five pillars: Academics, Activities, Outdoor Education, Personal and Social Education, and Service. For example, the Outdoor Education trips will push my child out of his comfort zone, building resilience, self-reliance, and a deep appreciation for the natural world. The Service program will be about developing genuine empathy, understanding privilege, and learning to collaborate with diverse communities to create positive change. Second,  our family values global citizenship, and UWCSEA offers a truly global and intercultural community. The diversity isn't just about nationality; it's about actively engaging with different perspectives, beliefs, and lived experiences every single day. For our child: Sitting in a classroom, working on a project, or sharing a meal with students from dozens of different countries will normalize diversity. It will teach them that their own perspective is one of many, fostering critical thinking, cross-cultural communication skills, and the ability to find common ground. This is an invaluable preparation for life and work in an interconnected world.
     - 2. How do you see your family engaging with UWCSEA's mission and ethos if you were to join our community?
       - 马平的建议回答：My family wouldn't see the UWC mission as something solely for their child to experience. We would actively engage as a family. We would prioritise attending talks, festivals, and events. We see these as opportunities for our own growth and understanding, not just as spectators but as participants, perhaps even volunteering to share aspects of our own cultural heritage. We would view parent-teacher conferences and curriculum evenings as two-way conversations. We'd want to understand how we can reinforce the school's approach. We would encourage and support our child's involvement in their chosen Service activities, We would look for ways to align our own family habits with the sustainability principles of UWCSEA's ethos.﻿
     - 3. Tell us something about your family's cultural background that we might not know just by looking at your passport nationalities.
       - 马平的建议回答：My father is an excellent IT engineer who graduated from Tsinghua University. He has previously worked at Oracle, Red Hat, Microsoft, and Amazon, and currently work in the finance field. My mother was an outstanding real estate IT director, responsible for managing the ERP system for critical business operations of the company. She directly and indirectly managed over 100 people at most.  Currently my mother accompanied me to study in Singapore.
     - 4. Is there anything else you would like us to know about the applicant or family?
       - 马平的建议回答：Our decision to apply to UWCSEA was a family decision, discussed at length around the dinner table. We see the UWCSEA education as a perfect alignment of values and ambition. Thank you for considering the whole person and the whole family behind this application.
