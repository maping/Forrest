- Section 12 of 15 Social, Activities And Interests

  - 1. What is the applicant's experience of dealing with academic and social pressure in a fast-paced learning environment?
    - I handle pressure by playing sports to release stress and listening to music to relax and stay focused.
    - 马平的建议回答：I use two primary tools to handle pressure. Playing a fast-paced sport like basketball allows me to channel that nervous energy into something positive and collaborative. Alternatively, listening to music provides a different kind of space for relaxing and mental organization.

  - 2. How does the applicant feel about the move to UWCSEA?
    - I feel excited and motivated about moving to UWCSEA. It’s a great opportunity to learn, grow, and meet people from different backgrounds.
    - 马平的建议回答：The idea of living and learning with students from over 70 nationalities is incredible. I am motivated by the chance to be both a learner and a contributor. I hope to share my own culture while actively listening to others, and I can't imagine a more powerful environment for that kind of mutual exchange than UWCSEA.

  - 3. Has the applicant received any award or special recognition that you would like us to be aware of?Please provide details.
    - SASMO Gold prize,as a significant play to get first in 14u Rugby 2024-2025 Season 2
    - 马平的建议回答：Yes, I have been fortunate to receive recognition in both academic and sporting fields, which I believe reflect my balanced approach to learning and life. SASMO (Singapore and Asian Schools Math Olympiad 2025) Grade 8 Gold Award: Winning the Gold Award was a validating moment that deepened my passion for mathematics and showed me the reward of sustained intellectual curiosity. Rugby Championship (2024-25 Season 2) : Being a 'significant player' meant I had to understand my teammates' strengths, make split-second decisions under pressure, and consistently support them on the field. Rugby has taught me the profound importance of trust, communication, and resilience. 
   
  - 4. Do you have any reservations about the applicant participating in College expeditions or in the social service programme?
    - I don’t have any reservations. I believe I can handle the challenges and will get the first 30 universities of the world in America or in the UK.
    - 马平的建议回答：These programmes are a primary reason for my application. I see expeditions and service not as separate activities, but as the practical application of what we learn in the classroom. I am eager to apply my energy and teamwork skills to these challenges. I see them as invaluable opportunities for personal growth and the best way to live out the UWC values in a practical, meaningful way.

  - 5. Interest/Activity details
    - I enjoy playing sports such as basketball and swimming because they keep me active, improve my focus, and teach me teamwork and discipline. I also love listening to music in my free time—it helps me relax, clear my mind, and stay motivated, especially during busy school days.
    - 马平的建议回答：Basketball and swimming are my physical and social outlets; one teaches me strategic communication and resilience in the face of a loss, while the other builds the solitary discipline to push through one more lap. Meanwhile, besides making me relax, music fuels my creativity and gives me a shared language to connect with others.
