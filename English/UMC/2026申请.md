  - 1. How have the places and people around you while growing up influenced who you are today?

I spent my primary school days in Beijing, China. Despite the high academic pressure, it laid a strong foundation for my future study, such as reading comprehension, physical fitness and math calculation skills. Through my interactions with classmates, I learned the importance of community, honesty, and responsibility, while also developing a resilient and humorous outlook. Recognizing the limitations of my English education, I dedicated myself to achieving fluency upon joining Anglo-Chinese. This two-year journey in ACS was more than an academic upgrade; it was a test of perseverance that taught me how to overcome a significant obstacle through sheer determination. My passion for rugby became the catalyst for my personal transformation. The sport's demand for discipline, teamwork, and relentless effort directly confronted my lack of motivation and self-doubt. On the field, I learned that victory is earned through resolve and that every setback is a lesson. Rugby didn't just make me fitter; it forged my self-discipline and competitive spirit. My six years of primary education in China, combined with two years of study at ACS, have fundamentally shaped the person I am today.

我在中国北京度过了小学时光。尽管学业压力繁重，这段经历却为我未来的学习奠定了坚实基础，无论是在阅读理解、身体素质还是数学计算能力方面都得到了显著提升。在与同窗相处的过程中，我体会到集体意识、诚实守信和责任担当的重要性，同时也培养了坚韧不拔的品格与幽默豁达的人生态度。认识到英语教育的不足后，进入英华学校时我便决心要精通这门语言。在ACS的两年求学之旅不仅是学业的提升，更是一场对毅力的考验——它教会我如何凭借纯粹的决心跨越重大障碍。对橄榄球的热爱成为了我蜕变的催化剂。这项运动要求的纪律性、团队协作和全力以赴的精神，直接正视了我缺乏动力和自我怀疑的弱点。在球场上，我领悟到胜利源于坚定的决心，而每次挫折都是宝贵的教训。橄榄球不仅增强了我的体魄，更锻造了我的自律意识和竞争精神。正是中国六年的小学教育与ACS两年的学习经历，根本性地塑造了如今的我。

  - 2. Could you share any interests, community involvement, or achievements from the past two years that reflect how 
you have spent your time and what matters to you?

As I mentioned previously, I have dedicated myself to playing rugby for the past two years. The game's rule to always move forward has inspired me to face challenges with the same determined spirit. Initially, I was afraid of the physicality, but through consistent training and matches, I gained tremendous courage and resilience. A key highlight was helping my team win a tough game by staying strong and encouraging my teammates. This experience, along with our team's victory in the Singapore Division 2 U14 Championship last year, taught me the profound value of perseverance and teamwork.

Just as I challenge myself on the rugby field, I also push myself academically. I have always had a strong interest in mathematics, which led me to join the math club at ACS. There, I learned from senior classmates and significantly improved my skills. I tested these skills by participating in the AMC competition in 2024, where I won a credit award for year 7. Seeing room for improvement, I dedicated myself to focused practice. This effort paid off when I registered for the SASMO competition in 2025 and ultimately won a gold medal for year 8. This journey in math taught me a similar lesson to rugby: that perseverance in the face of a challenge is the key to growth and achievement.

正如我先前提到的，过去两年我全心投入英式橄榄球运动。这项运动"永远向前"的规则，激励我以同样坚定的精神面对挑战。最初我曾畏惧其身体对抗性，但通过持续的训练和比赛，我获得了巨大的勇气和韧性。一个重要里程碑是在一场艰难赛事中，我通过顽强坚持并鼓励队友，帮助团队赢得了胜利。这段经历，加之我们队伍去年荣获 Division 2 新加坡U14锦标赛冠军，让我深刻体会到坚持与团队合作的珍贵价值。

正如我在橄榄球场上挑战自我，在学术领域我也不断追求突破。始终对数学怀有浓厚兴趣的我，因此加入了ACS的数学俱乐部。在那里，我从学长们的指导中获益良多，数学能力得到显著提升。2024年，我通过参加AMC竞赛检验学习成果，并获得七年级组优秀奖（Credit Award）。认识到尚有进步空间后，我投身于针对性训练，这份努力在2025年参加SASMO竞赛时获得回报——最终斩获八年级组金牌。这条数学探索之路给予我与橄榄球运动相似的启示：面对挑战时的坚持不懈，正是成长与成就的关键。

  - 3. I am applying to UWCSEA because … [limited to 300 words]

My goal is to ensure that my grades are not the sole measure of my identity. Of course, I am determined to do well academically, but I also aspire to grow in other ways. I hope to gain a broader global perspective, an international mindset, and develop in all areas: knowledge, character, creativity, health, and responsibility.

This is precisely why UWCSEA attracts me. Its mission of peace, sustainability, and global citizenship fits closely with my personal goals. The academically rigorous IB programme is perfectly complemented by UWCSEA's focus on service, outdoor education, activities, and personal growth—a holistic approach that matches my belief that school should prepare us for life, not just exams.

I am especially drawn to the service programme. Unlike at many schools, service here is mandatory, not optional. Projects such as Repair Kopitiam, where students fix household appliances to reduce waste, or the Green Heart initiative, which restores native trees, demonstrate how learning is applied to create real change. The outdoor education programme, with expeditions from Singapore to places like Nepal or Mongolia, would build my resilience, teamwork, and leadership. I am also eager to explore some of the 600+ activities, from debating and Model United Nations to music and innovation projects, which are designed to foster creativity, confidence, and collaboration.

With these unparalleled opportunities, I am confident that UWCSEA is the ideal environment to help me achieve both strong academics and profound personal growth. It will prepare me not only for university but also for becoming a proactive individual who can make a positive difference in the world.

我的目标是确保成绩并非衡量我个人的唯一标准。当然，我决心在学术上取得优异成绩，但同时也渴望在其他方面获得成长。我希望拓宽全球视野、培养国际思维，并在知识、品格、创造力、健康与责任感等各方面全面发展。

这正是UWCSEA吸引我的原因。学校倡导和平、可持续发展与全球公民意识的使命，与我的个人目标高度契合。学术严谨的IB课程与UWCSEA注重服务、户外教育、活动和个人成长的理念相得益彰——这种全面发展的教育理念与我"学校应为人生而非仅为考试做准备"的信念不谋而合。

我尤其被学校的服务项目所吸引。与多数学校不同，这里的社区服务是必修而非选修项目。诸如"维修咖啡店"（学生通过维修家电减少废弃物）、"绿色之心"（恢复原生树木种植）等项目，都展现了如何将所学知识转化为实际改变。户外教育项目组织从新加坡到尼泊尔、蒙古等地的远征活动，这将培养我的韧性、团队协作力和领导力。我也热切期待探索600余项课外活动，从辩论、模拟联合国到音乐与创新项目，这些活动旨在培养创造力、自信与协作能力。

凭借这些无与伦比的机遇，我相信UWCSEA是帮助我实现学术成就与个人深度成长的理想环境。它不仅为我进入大学做好准备，更将培养我成为能够为世界带来积极影响的积极主动之人。

  - 4. What are your thoughts on the university courses or careers you would like to explore? (Grade 10 and Grade 11 only)

I am still exploring different university possibilities, but I find Stanford University particularly inspiring. Its focus on innovation, global responsibility, and applying knowledge to solve real-world problems resonates deeply with me, as it directly extends the holistic education I have valued at UWCSEA.

I am drawn to interdisciplinary programs that combine economics, international relations, and sustainability. These fields are directly linked to my goals of developing a sophisticated global outlook and learning how to drive positive change in society.

While I am still exploring specific career paths, I hope to find one that allows me to balance academic rigor with creativity and a deep sense of responsibility. Ultimately, I want a career that contributes meaningfully to the broader global community.

我仍在探索不同的大学选择，但斯坦福大学尤其令我向往。该校专注于创新、全球责任以及运用知识解决现实问题的理念，与我曾在UWCSEA接受的 holistic（全人）教育一脉相承，深深契合我的价值观。

我深受经济学、国际关系与可持续发展相结合的跨学科项目吸引。这些领域与我培养全球视野、学习如何推动社会积极变革的目标直接相关。

虽然我仍在探索具体的职业道路，但我希望找到一条能兼顾学术严谨性、创造力与深刻社会责任感的道路。最终，我渴望从事能对全球社会做出有意义贡献的事业。

   - Part II
     - 1. Reflecting on your child's and your family's journey, what aspects of UWCSEA might help your child continue to grow and flourish?
       - 马平的建议回答：First，our child will thrive through UWCSEA’s commitment to experiential education, which includes five pillars: Academics, Activities, Outdoor Education, Personal and Social Education, and Service. For example, the Outdoor Education trips will push my child out of his comfort zone, building resilience, self-reliance, and a deep appreciation for the natural world. The Service program will be about developing genuine empathy, understanding privilege, and learning to collaborate with diverse communities to create positive change. Second,  our family values global citizenship, and UWCSEA offers a truly global and intercultural community. The diversity isn't just about nationality; it's about actively engaging with different perspectives, beliefs, and lived experiences every single day. For our child: Sitting in a classroom, working on a project, or sharing a meal with students from dozens of different countries will normalize diversity. It will teach them that their own perspective is one of many, fostering critical thinking, cross-cultural communication skills, and the ability to find common ground. This is an invaluable preparation for life and work in an interconnected world.
     - 2. How do you see your family engaging with UWCSEA's mission and ethos if you were to join our community?
       - 马平的建议回答：My family wouldn't see the UWC mission as something solely for their child to experience. We would actively engage as a family. We would prioritise attending talks, festivals, and events. We see these as opportunities for our own growth and understanding, not just as spectators but as participants, perhaps even volunteering to share aspects of our own cultural heritage. We would view parent-teacher conferences and curriculum evenings as two-way conversations. We'd want to understand how we can reinforce the school's approach. We would encourage and support our child's involvement in their chosen Service activities, We would look for ways to align our own family habits with the sustainability principles of UWCSEA's ethos.﻿
     - 3. Tell us something about your family's cultural background that we might not know just by looking at your passport nationalities.
       - 马平的建议回答：My father is an excellent IT engineer who graduated from Tsinghua University.
