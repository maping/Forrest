## 第一节
At 15, I excelled academically yet felt overshadowed and unnoticed. The **desire** to stand out consumed me, pushing me towards a regrettable decision.

One day, during a class in the IT lab with my classmates, our teacher mentioned missing computer parts. **Curious** looks exchanged, everyone wondered how it could happen in a **locked** lab. "It's possible to open that lock with another key," I said. Instantly, eyes turned to me with newfound interest and curiosity. It was a rush I had never experienced before. Enjoying all the eyes on me, I **demonstrated** how to open the lock.

Little did I realize that single moment would ruin everything.

The following day, called to the headmaster's office, I found myself accused of stealing the missing parts. "I didn't do it, sir," I argued, but suspicion **clouded** his eyes. His repeated **questioning** intensified, pushing me to the edge of fear and tears. In a desperate attempt to escape the mounting pressure, I **falsely** confessed.

The headmaster asked my father to come to school, whose shaky faith in me brought a mix of relief and **shame**. My father gently asked me if I understood the gravity of my actions. **Tearfully**, I confessed my misguided longing for recognition. In the headmaster's office, my father listened attentively, and then spoke with quiet authority: "I trust my son. He is not a thief."

With my father's support, I learned a valuable lesson: **attention** cannot be forced; true recognition comes from honourable acts.

40.Mark was upset seeing that many plastic bottles littered the parks and sidewalks. 41.The app maps small local parks and gardens few people knew about, helping people explore hidden places in their own cities. 42."With encouragement from his friends and parents"  This sentence states that friends laughed and Mark’s parents thought he should give up, indicating a lack of encouragement. 43.Like Mark and Sally, I would identify a real-world problem, research solutions, and persistently test ideas despite failures. For example, creating recycling projects or apps to help communities. Their stories teach us that imagination becomes innovation through action and resilience.

作文：I suggest proposing a global initiative to promote eco-friendly habits among teenagers, such as reducing plastic use or organizing community clean-ups. This topic is urgent because environmental issues affect everyone, and young people can lead by example. It’s also practical—small actions add up to big changes. Let me know if you’d like help refining the idea!
