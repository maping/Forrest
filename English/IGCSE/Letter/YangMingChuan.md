Hi,Yang Ming Chuan

I hope you’re doing well! I wanted to share some thoughts on how digital devices are impacting students like us.

On the bright side, digital tools make learning much more flexible. We can access resources anytime and anywhere, which is super convenient. Also, with personalized learning platforms, we can study at our own pace, focusing on what we find challenging. Plus, interactive tools make lessons more engaging, like using games and online quizzes.

But there are some downsides too. Sometimes, there’s just too much information online, which can be overwhelming. It can also be hard to stay focused with all the distractions from social media and games, making it difficult to pay attention in class. Additionally, not everyone has equal access to technology, which can create gaps in learning among students.

Overall, while digital devices can enhance our education, we need to be careful about the challenges they bring. Let me know what you think!

Best regards,
Ma Qing Chuan
