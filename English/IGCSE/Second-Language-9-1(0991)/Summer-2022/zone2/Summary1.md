Your class is going on a school trip next Tuesday. It’s a trip we’ve done for several years, and it has always been a huge success.
Please read this information carefully so you know what to expect.

If you intend to come on the school bus, please let me know in advance. If someone is bringing you by car, meet at the park ticket office at 10.30. Just make sure you 1️⃣**don’t park next to the entrance – this space is reserved for park employees.** Another point is that park rules concerning school trips have changed since last year, when you had to wear your school uniform. This is no longer the case, but you do need to 2️⃣**have your school ID on you at all times.**

There are two activities available next Tuesday – you can choose between photography and drawing. All materials will be provided. You will also have some free time to explore the park, but remember you 3️⃣**mustn’t climb on the sculptures.** There’s nothing wrong with running around though – there is plenty of space for that – but 4️⃣**ball games are not allowed.** Also, there are horses and sheep in some parts of the park. We have been told that it’s important 5️⃣**not to feed them**, although you can certainly take photographs of them if you like. One thing to remember is that when you go through any gate in the park, you 6️⃣**must close it behind you**. You’ll see lots of beautiful flowers in the park, but please 7️⃣**don’t pick any of them.** 

There are several taps around the park with drinking water, so if you bring a reusable bottle with you, you can fill it up for free. Please bring your own lunch with you. You’re allowed to eat anywhere in the park, but you 8️⃣**must take all your rubbish away with you afterwards** – you’ll see notices about this at the park.

These are all rules set out by the park itself, not by school, and it’s important to respect them.

I hope you all enjoy the trip!

Attendees must bring their school ID and should not park near the entrance, as that area is designated for staff.
