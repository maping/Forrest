Here is a 115-word summary covering the harmful effects of light pollution and what people can do to reduce it:

Light pollution has numerous detrimental effects. It can disconnect people from nature, disrupt wildlife's hunting and navigation, and distract drivers with sudden bright lights. Additionally, electronic displays and lighting can cause sleep disturbances. To combat light pollution, people should avoid unnecessary lighting and ensure outdoor lights are directed downwards only where needed. Lighting near roads should be moderately bright. Avoiding devices an hour before bed and closing curtains at night can also help. By taking these simple steps, people can reduce the harmful impacts of light pollution and reconnect with the natural nighttime environment.

Forrest：

Light pollution disrupts nighttime hunting for various animals, making it crucial to turn off lights when they aren’t in use. Additionally, it disorients birds that rely on natural light for navigation, so we should ensure outdoor lighting is directed downwards, illuminating only necessary areas. Moreover, excessively bright streetlights can distract drivers, increasing the risk of traffic accidents. The light emitted by electronic devices can also interfere with our sleep, even after they’ve been turned off. To promote better sleep hygiene, parents should encourage their children to stop using screens at least an hour before bedtime. Taking these simple steps can help protect wildlife, improve safety, and enhance our overall well-being.
