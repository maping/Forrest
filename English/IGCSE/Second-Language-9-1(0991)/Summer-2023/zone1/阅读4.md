Here is a 115-word summary covering the harmful effects of light pollution and what people can do to reduce it:

Light pollution has numerous detrimental effects. It can disconnect people from nature, disrupt wildlife's hunting and navigation, and distract drivers with sudden bright lights. Additionally, electronic displays and lighting can cause sleep disturbances. To combat light pollution, people should avoid unnecessary lighting and ensure outdoor lights are directed downwards only where needed. Lighting near roads should be moderately bright. Avoiding devices an hour before bed and closing curtains at night can also help. By taking these simple steps, people can reduce the harmful impacts of light pollution and reconnect with the natural nighttime environment.

Forrest：

Light pollution prevents animals from hunting food successfully at night,so we need to turn the light off when we are not using it, and it also confuses birds to find their way home,so we need to make sure that outdoor light is only aimed downwards to where it is needed. Light pollution affects humans when they are driving,the drivers can be distracted by sudden bright lights and cause traffic accidents so we shouldn’t make the streetlamp too bright.The light from electronic devices can disturb our sleep even after we switch them off,and parents should tell the children stop using devices an  hour before bedtime.
