After careful planning, the big morning finally arrived: a two-day hike in the mountains with my classmates. Our teachers had given us advice, and would meet us at the beginning and end of each day, but otherwise we were on our own.

We set off at top speed, but the six hours of hiking still to come soon made us realise that 1Ô∏è‚É£**walking at a steady pace is better than racing.** Luckily, our teachers had given us a great tip: to 2Ô∏è‚É£**share essential equipment.** We‚Äôd therefore only packed one of the things we could share among us, like a kettle and a camping stove. Even so, we found it a challenge to carry our backpacks. It became clear that 3Ô∏è‚É£**the lighter your backpack, the more comfortable you are.**

By the afternoon, we were heading towards the campsite but were suddenly surprised to find ourselves near a forest. We must have taken a wrong turning, and in a panic started arguing about which way to go. We realised that we hadn‚Äôt been 4Ô∏è‚É£**checking the map regularly** and that‚Äôs exactly what we should have been doing. It made us all aware, not only of the importance of 5Ô∏è‚É£**keeping calm if you get lost,** but also 6Ô∏è‚É£**how to work in a team.** Luckily we managed to get back on the right path without too much difficulty.

The next morning we cooked a huge breakfast. I don‚Äôt usually eat much in the mornings, but after the previous day‚Äôs hike I knew 7Ô∏è‚É£**this would provide the energy I needed.** It was a sunny morning and we set off in high spirits. As we walked, it became more humid. The pleasant day was quickly turning into a mountain storm and soon the rain was pouring and we were cold. I understood then 8Ô∏è‚É£**how quickly the weather in the mountains can change.**

Some people started complaining about being tired and wet and the end seemed a long way off. But eventually, we arrived home safe and I was really proud that I‚Äôd done it. It made me appreciate that 9Ô∏è‚É£**I‚Äôm more capable than I thought.**
