After careful planning, the big morning finally arrived: a two-day hike in the mountains with my classmates. Our teachers had given us advice,
and would meet us at the beginning and end of each day, but otherwise we were on our own.

We set off at top speed, but the six hours of hiking still to come soon made us realise that walking at a steady pace is better than racing. Luckily, our
teachers had given us a great tip: to share essential equipment. We’d therefore only packed one of the things we could share among us, like
a kettle and a camping stove. Even so, we found it a challenge to carry our backpacks. It became clear that the lighter your backpack, the more comfortable you are.

By the afternoon, we were heading towards the campsite but were suddenly surprised to find ourselves near a forest. We must have taken a wrong turning, and in a panic started arguing about
which way to go. We realised that we hadn’t been checking the map regularly and that’s exactly what we should have been doing. It made us all aware, not only of the importance of keeping calm
if you get lost, but also how to work in a team. Luckily we managed to get back on the right path without too much difficulty.

The next morning we cooked a huge breakfast. I don’t usually eat much in the mornings, but after the previous day’s hike I knew this would provide the energy I needed. It was a sunny morning
and we set off in high spirits. As we walked, it became more humid. The pleasant day was quickly turning into a mountain storm and soon the rain was pouring and we were cold. I understood then
how quickly the weather in the mountains can change.

Some people started complaining about being tired and wet and the end seemed a long way off. But eventually, we arrived home safe and I was really proud that I’d done it. It made me appreciate
that I’m more capable than I thought.
