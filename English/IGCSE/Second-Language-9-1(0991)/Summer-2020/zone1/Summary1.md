Nowadays, we all keep a huge amount of information on our computers and phones, like electronic messages and photos. If you‚Äôve ever lost important information from your computer, or your phone, you‚Äôll know how annoying this can be! Nowadays, however, governments, businesses and people who are concerned about losing valuable data or photos can relax a bit more. There is a large data storage facility, called the Arctic World Archive, which opened in March 2017.

The archive is found on an island between mainland Norway and the North Pole. It is 1Ô∏è‚É£**300 metres below the ground, and protected from the Arctic conditions above.** The 2Ô∏è‚É£**temperature underground does not vary a great deal**, and this makes it suitable for storing data securely. The fact that no extra energy is needed to maintain the temperature means there is no need for temperature control equipment. And because 3Ô∏è‚É£**the island is in a very remote location**, it is 4Ô∏è‚É£**unlikely that anyone would try to access it.**

A company has developed the technology to store people‚Äôs data by transferring it onto 5Ô∏è‚É£**special digital film which lasts 500 years.** This is considerably longer than some other methods of data storage. 6Ô∏è‚É£**The data on this digital film cannot be edited in any way by anyone.** People wanting to use the archive send data to the company, and once it is stored, they can ask to get it back at any time. This is not an immediate process though. For extra security, 7Ô∏è‚É£**the data held in the archive is not connected to the internet.** When a request for stored information is made, staff at the archive have to go and physically collect the relevant digital film. This is then sent electronically using 8Ô∏è‚É£**a special safe cable which is connected to the mainland.** This procedure can take half an hour or more. But in these days of online security problems around the world, this is well worth the wait!
