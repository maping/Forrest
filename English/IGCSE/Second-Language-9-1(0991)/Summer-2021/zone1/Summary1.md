I used to think there was nothing much to do in the small town where I live. My friends and I would spend our holidays wondering how to fill our time – that is,
until we discovered geocaching. Now, geocaching gives me something to do whenever I have some spare time.

So, what is geocaching? It’s an outdoor activity which involves looking for small containers, usually plastic boxes, hidden in different locations. You download an app onto your mobile phone and use a maap to work out where to find them. It’s a bit like a digital treasure 
hunt!

My teacher introduced our class to geocaching during a school trip to a local forest. We were divided into teams and then we set off, following the directions on our phones. Each team wanted to be first
to find the hidden container. Geocaching really helps you notice your surroundings. My team quickly realised from the map that we needed to find a  square-shaped  rock and we  ran off to look for it. 
Suddenly there it was! We looked all around and soon found the container hidden under a pile of leaves – we were the winners! We all agreed that it’s a fun way to exercise outdoors. It can help us 
to improve our technological skills too.

Back in the classroom, we learned more about geocaching, which started in 2001. It’s not just a team activity – you can either do it with other people or alone. Inside every container, there’s a notebook 
which people sometimes leave messages in. Some containers also have small objects in them. If you want, you can exchange the objects for something of your own, which most people like to do.
Geocaching can be done anywhere. Since that first school trip, I’ve done geocaching at home, and even during holidays in Dubai, New York and Australia. No matter where I do it, I always get a feeling
of satisfaction. My boring, small town is now my adventure playground – every week geocaching gives me new places to explore.
