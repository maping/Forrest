I used to think there was nothing much to do in the small town where I live. My friends and I would spend our holidays wondering how to fill our time – that is, until we discovered geocaching. Now, 1️⃣**geocaching gives me something to do whenever I have some spare time.**

So, what is geocaching? It’s an outdoor activity which involves looking for small containers, usually plastic boxes, hidden in different locations. You download an app onto your mobile phone and use a map to work out where to find them. It’s a bit like a digital treasure hunt!

My teacher introduced our class to geocaching during a school trip to a local forest. We were divided into teams and then we set off, following the directions on our phones. Each team wanted to be first to find the hidden container. 2️⃣**Geocaching really helps you notice your surroundings.** My team quickly realised from the map that we needed to find a square-shaped  rock and we  ran off to look for it. Suddenly there it was! We looked all around and soon found the container hidden under a pile of leaves – we were the winners! We all agreed that 3️⃣**it’s a fun way to exercise outdoors.** It can help us to 4️⃣**improve our technological skills too.**

Back in the classroom, we learned more about geocaching, which started in 2001. It’s not just a team activity – 5️⃣**you can either do it with other people or alone.** Inside every container, there’s a notebook which people sometimes leave messages in. Some containers also have small objects in them. If you want, 6️⃣**you can exchange the objects for something of your own, which most people like to do.**

7️⃣**Geocaching can be done anywhere.** Since that first school trip, I’ve done geocaching at home, and even during holidays in Dubai, New York and Australia. No matter where I do it, I always 8️⃣**get a feeling of satisfaction.** My boring, small town is now my adventure playground – every week geocaching 9️⃣**gives me new places to explore.**
