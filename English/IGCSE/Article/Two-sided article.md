# Are ACS International Students Saving the Environment?

The topic of whether students at ACS International are effectively contributing to environmental conservation has sparked a lively debate. While some argue that the school community is making meaningful efforts, others feel that more can be done to make a real impact.

On one hand, many believe that ACS students are actively involved in saving the environment. For example, students participate in recycling programs and organizedle events like Earth Day. These actions show their commitment to making a positive difference. According to supporters, these initiatives prove that students are aware of their responsibility to protect the planet.
However, critics argue that these efforts are not as impactful as they seem. While some students participate in environmental activities, many do so out of obligation rather than genuine passion. For instance, recycling bins may be used during school hours, but after-school habits like littering or using plastic continue unchecked. Additionally, some students attend environmental events just to fulfil community service hours, without committing to long-term changes in their behaviour. Critics believe that, for real progress, students must make sustainability a lifestyle choice, not just a short-term
school project.

In conclusion, while students at ACS International are taking steps towards
environmental conservation, there is room for improvement. A greater focus on long-
term, consistent efforts could lead to a more significant impact in the future.
