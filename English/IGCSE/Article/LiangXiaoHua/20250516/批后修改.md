**Beach Cleaning**

www.cleanyourbeach.com

Did you know that millions of tonnes of plastic are thrown into our oceans every year? Sadly, much of it ends up on beaches around the world.

What can you do about this? One simple answer is to help clean a beach near you. You can take part in a beach-cleaning event that has already been organised, or, even better, organise one of your own! If you’d like to have a go at this, the first thing to do is look at the Clean Your Beach website. You’ll find all sorts of useful information there. Pick a beach where an event isn’t already scheduled – that way we can all make as big an impact as possible! You’ll need to choose a time that’s convenient for you, which could be a weekday or a weekend, morning, afternoon or evening. Then register your event on the website. If you do this, you can also order a free beach-cleaning kit, which contains enough equipment for 25 volunteers. Don’t forget to tell your friends and neighbours too. After all, you can’t clean an entire beach by yourself!

There are so many reasons why you should organise a beach-cleaning event. You’ll get fresh air and exercise, and you’ll be doing something positive too. As well as being rewarding, it can be great fun too! We suggest that you arrange some refreshments for the volunteers – they’ll thank you for these after you’ve all finished cleaning the beach together. Then the only remaining thing to do is upload your results to the website. We’re keeping a record of what people find, and how much of it has been collected. So far, our events have removed just under 150 000 kilos of rubbish from our beaches. But there’s more to do. Our beaches need you – so why not do something about it today?

To organise and run your own beach-cleaning event, first visit the Clean Your Beach website for helpful information. Choose a beach that doesn’t already have an event planned, and select a time that suits you. Register your event on the website to receive a free kit with tools for 25 volunteers. Invite friends and neighbours to join you, as teamwork is important. Provide refreshments for everyone after the clean-up. Finally, upload your results to the website to support the national effort and track the rubbish collected.

# Article 作业
Your school/college is planning to introduce compulsory sport/PE for all students, every day.

Here are some comments from some students in your class:
- “I can’t stand doing sport, especially team games.”
- “It’s great – we’ll all become much healthier because of this.”
- “A bad idea – we will lose vital time to prepare for exams!”
- “I don’t mind – just as long as we have a good choice of things to do.”

Write an article for your school/college magazine giving your views about the issue.

The comments above may give you some ideas, but you are free to use any ideas of your own.

Your article should be about 200 words long.

Students Should Have Compulsory PE Everyday

As time goes by, students spend more and more time studying, which leads to a decline in their physical fitness. Some people think that having a strong body is more important than grades, but some people think that grades are the only thing for students. I choose the former explaination.

Firstly, doing sports every day can greatly improve our health. Students often face long hours of study and heavy stress. Regular physical activity helps us stay fit and improves our mental health by reducing stress and boosting energy. It also helps us concentrate better in class. In fact, research has shown that students who are active tend to perform better academically. For example, some of my friends who play basketball regularly seem more focused and energetic in lessons.

Secondly, sport is a great way to build teamwork skills. Many sports require students to cooperate, communicate, and support each other. This is useful not only in school projects but also in future jobs. Take football, for instance you can not win without good coordination and trust between players.

In conclusion, making sport compulsory can benefit us in many ways. However, to make it fair, students should have a choice of activities. That way, everyone can enjoy it and get the most out of it.

Daily PE: A Step Towards Health or a Waste of Time?

The proposal to introduce compulsory daily PE has sparked mixed reactions among students. While some welcome the idea for its health benefits, others worry about its impact on academic performance and personal preferences.

On the positive side, daily physical activity can significantly improve fitness and mental well-being. As one student noted, it could help us all become healthier, reducing stress and boosting energy levels. However, forcing students into team sports may backfire, as not everyone enjoys them. Offering a variety of activities—like yoga, swimming, or dance—could make PE more inclusive and enjoyable.

On the other hand, students preparing for exams argue that daily PE might eat into crucial study time. Balancing academics and exercise is essential, so perhaps shorter sessions or flexible timings could address this concern.

Ultimately, the success of this policy depends on its implementation. A well-structured program with diverse options could make PE beneficial for everyone, while a rigid approach might lead to resentment. If the school listens to student feedback and finds a middle ground, daily PE could become a highlight of our routine—not a chore.
