Your school/college is planning to introduce compulsory sport/PE for all students, every day.

Here are some comments from some students in your class:
- “I can’t stand doing sport, especially team games.”
- “It’s great – we’ll all become much healthier because of this.”
- “A bad idea – we will lose vital time to prepare for exams!”
- “I don’t mind – just as long as we have a good choice of things to do.”

Write an article for your school/college magazine giving your views about the issue.

The comments above may give you some ideas, but you are free to use any ideas of your own.

Your article should be about 200 words long.

Daily PE: A Step Towards Health or a Waste of Time?

The proposal to introduce compulsory daily PE has sparked mixed reactions among students. While some welcome the idea for its health benefits, others worry about its impact on academic performance and personal preferences.

On the positive side, daily physical activity can significantly improve fitness and mental well-being. As one student noted, it could help us all become healthier, reducing stress and boosting energy levels. However, forcing students into team sports may backfire, as not everyone enjoys them. Offering a variety of activities—like yoga, swimming, or dance—could make PE more inclusive and enjoyable.

On the other hand, students preparing for exams argue that daily PE might eat into crucial study time. Balancing academics and exercise is essential, so perhaps shorter sessions or flexible timings could address this concern.

Ultimately, the success of this policy depends on its implementation. A well-structured program with diverse options could make PE beneficial for everyone, while a rigid approach might lead to resentment. If the school listens to student feedback and finds a middle ground, daily PE could become a highlight of our routine—not a chore.
