**How the potato travelled the world**

Wherever you travel, people consider the potato to be part of their local food. Potato can be cooked in many different ways and so is now found in a wide variety of dishes from Indian aloo gobi to Italian gnocchi. Until the middle of the 16th century though, this easy-to-grow vegetable was only found in South America. How then, in just a few centuries, did it become such a globally familiar food?

In 17th and 18th century Europe, many people didn’t own any land and instead had to pay rent for the land they farmed. They often chose to grow potatoes, which had been introduced from South America previously, as these plants could produce a large amount of food in a small space. Potatoes also contain some important vitamins needed for human health, so it’s no surprise that they became highly valued by farmers trying to feed their families.

There were many aspects to the potato’s appeal. Although potato plants initially struggled to survive in the cold European winters, farmers eventually produced varieties of potato that were able to adapt to the local climate, and the potato became the main food crop in Europe. By the 19th century, potatoes were being grown across the world – from Asia to Africa, China to North America – in part due to the fact that they were cheap. Although potatoes could be stored well, the limited number of varieties meant that potato plants were sometimes destroyed by disease before they were able to produce a crop. So, in the early 20th century, scientists started trying to find a solution. Eventually they were successful and managed to produce a range of varieties that could resist disease.

Today, the world’s top potato producers are China, India, Russia and Ukraine. The potato is now a genuinely global food crop.

Education vs. Experience: What Really Shapes Your Future?

The relationship between education and career success is more complex than it appears. While formal education undoubtedly provides advantages, it's not the only path to professional achievement.

Education offers clear benefits. It equips students with specialized knowledge, develops critical thinking skills, and provides qualifications that many employers require. As one student pointed out, strong academic performance often correlates with higher earning potential. Certain fields like medicine, law, or engineering particularly value formal education.

However, the tech entrepreneur's story reminds us that real-world experience and initiative can be equally valuable. Some industries prioritize skills over degrees, and success stories like Steve Jobs or Richard Branson prove that unconventional paths can lead to remarkable achievements.

What matters most is aligning your approach with your goals. For some careers, education is essential; for others, hands-on experience might be more valuable. As another comment wisely noted, education can be pursued at any life stage when needed.

Ultimately, while education improves opportunities for many, success depends on how you apply your knowledge, skills, and determination in the real world. The best approach combines learning with practical experience tailored to your ambitions.
