Hammarby lake City in Sweden is a housing project designed to be environmentally friendly. It uses energy efficiently by burning household waste to produce heating and electricity. Rainwater is recycled and stored from lakes and streams, attracting wildlife and providing habitats. The city also promotes clean transport through tram and car-sharing, reducing private car use. Pedestrian and bicycle networks make travel safe and convenient. With green spaces, roof gardens, and energy-saving buildings, Hammarby aims to house 20,000 residents and 10,000 workers. Its design has inspired similar sustainable communities.
