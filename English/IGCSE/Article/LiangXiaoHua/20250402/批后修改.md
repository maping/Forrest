Cars – Love Them or Hate Them

It is only just over 130 years ago that the first car was invented. In the context of the millions of years since the beginning of our planet Earth, that is no time at all. And yet, because cars are such an essential part of our lives, it seems as though they have always been with us.

Gina O’Donnell, a young marketing executive who runs international campaigns to sell Italian-designed cars worldwide, says: “Part of my job is to find out why people drive cars. People choose cars for many different reasons. Some say they are looking for a car that gives them the sense of freedom they desire. Others say their vehicle is essential because they have to take their children to school every day.” Priya Patel, a mother of three boys attending distant schools, acknowledges the pollution caused by her daily trips but feels she has no alternative. For others, cars express personality: “When I’m driving my sports car on a sunny day, with the top down, I feel like a teenage rock star,” jokes a senior manager.

However, cars come with consequences. Expansive concrete roads may mar rural landscapes. While some predict growing road demand, others advocate for public transport or car-sharing schemes to mitigate flooding risks caused by poor rainwater drainage.

The global car industry employs millions, from marketers like Gina to engineers and quality controllers. Cars are equally vital to small businesses for transporting goods, yet parking demands encroach on urban green spaces.

On a positive note, innovations like recycled vegetable oil fuels and electric vehicles offer eco-friendlier alternatives. The central dilemma remains: Do cars’ daily benefits outweigh their environmental toll? This debate will undoubtedly persist for years.
