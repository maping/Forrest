### **Blessing**  
*By Imtiaz Dharker*  

The skin cracks like a pod.  
There never is enough water.  

Imagine the drip of it,  
the small splash, echo  
in a tin mug,  
the voice of a kindly god.  

Sometimes, the sudden rush  
of fortune. The municipal pipe bursts,  
silver crashes to the ground,  
and the flow has found  
a roar of tongues. From the huts,  
a congregation: every man woman  
child for streets around  
butts in, with pots,  
brass, copper, aluminium,  
plastic buckets,  
frantic hands,  

and naked children  
screaming in the liquid sun,  
their highlights polished to perfection,  
flashing light,  
as the blessing sings  
over their small bones.
