Writing Task

In your English class, you have had a discussion about the way that using technology can affect your social life.

Here are some comments from students in your class:
- My sister spends far too much time chatting with friends on the phone!
- I can easily find out what’s on and where parties are.
- It’s easy to connect with other people – wherever they live.
- I’ve got lots of ‘friends’ on social media – but they’re not real friends.

Write an article for your school magazine, giving your views.

The comments above may give you some ideas, and you should try to use some ideas of your own.

Your article should be between 100 and 150 words long.

You will receive up to 7 marks for the content of your article, and up to 6 marks for the style and accuracy of your language.
