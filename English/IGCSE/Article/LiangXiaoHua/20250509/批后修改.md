**Beautiful bonsai**

My passion for growing bonsai trees started twenty years ago when I was studying in Japan. The family I was living with had a collection of tiny, old bonsai in pots that had been given to them by their grandparents. For the family, growing these plants was not just about caring for something precious - it was about creating something beautiful. Before long, I was a bonsai fan too!

My first bonsai wasn't a great success. To make a bonsai grow into an attractive shape, you need to cut the branches every year. I was a beginner though, so this first tree ended up quite ugly! I tried again and my second bonsai was much better, so I grew more. I made mistakes, of course. Like many people, I planted my bonsai in ordinary soil at first, but I soon realised it was better to add small stones to the soil. I also learned how to lift a bonsai out of its pot to cut its roots, which helps prevent it from becoming too big.

Once a bonsai has a shape you like, looking after them becomes more straightforward. Only water them when they're nearly dry, so it shouldn't take up too much time. Just remember to feed them once a month or so - this is now part of my regular routine, and seems to work well. Like many bonsai fans, I'm a member of my local bonsai society. That's where I learned how important it is to use good quality tools, for example. It's also where I've made many new friends who share my passion.

I'm happy with my trees now, although I have nearly lost one or two of them. Last December, one of my favorites almost died in the freezing temperatures. If you're going to grow bonsai outside, it's essential to protect them in the winter months. And you have to treat any diseases immediately, whatever the season. After twenty years, I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I definitely know a lot more about bonsai now than I did before.

Technology has changed the way we live and communicate. Some people think it creates problems, while others can believe it helps us stay connected with others. In my opinion, technology can have a positive effect on our social life.

Firstly, it is easier to fly keep in touch with friends and family through phones and social media even if they live far away. This means we don‚Äôt lose contact with important people in our lives.

Secondly, technology makes finding social events effortless. ‚Ä¶With apps like Instagram or Meetup. I instantly see parties and concerts nearby. Last week, I discovered a street tour through a group chat - no flyers or calls needed. While some say tech cookies us, it actually helps people connect in real life.
