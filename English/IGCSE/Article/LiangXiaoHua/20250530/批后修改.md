**School trip to Blackfoot Sculpture Park**

Your class is going on a school trip next Tuesday. It’s a trip we’ve done for several years, and it has always been a huge success. Please read this information carefully so you know what to expect.

If you intend to come on the school bus, please let me know in advance. If someone is bringing you by car, meet at the park ticket office at 10.30. Just make sure you don’t park next to the entrance – this space is reserved for park employees. Another point is that park rules concerning school trips have changed since last year, when you had to wear your school uniform. This is no longer the case, but you do need to have your school ID on you at all times.

There are two activities available next Tuesday – you can choose between photography and drawing. All materials will be provided. You will also have some free time to explore the park, but remember you mustn’t climb on the sculptures. There’s nothing wrong with running around though – there is plenty of space for that – but ball games are not allowed. Also, there are horses and sheep in some parts of the park. We have been told that it’s important not to feed them, although you can certainly take photographs of them if you like. One thing to remember is that when you go through any gate in the park, you must close it behind you. You’ll see lots of beautiful flowers in the park, but please don’t pick any of them.

There are several taps around the park with drinking water, so if you bring a reusable bottle with you, you can fill it up for free. Please bring your own lunch with you. You’re allowed to eat anywhere in the park, but you must take all your rubbish away with you afterwards – you’ll see notices about this at the park.

These are all rules set out by the park itself, not by school, and it’s important to respect them.

I hope you all enjoy the trip!

Pupils need to carry their school identification at all times, though uniforms are not required. They can choose between taking photos or sketching, with supplies provided. Climbing artworks is forbidden, but running is permitted—playing with balls is not. Feeding animals is prohibited, but pictures may be taken. All gates should be shut after passing through, and removing plants is not allowed. Reusable containers can be filled at water stations. Meals may be eaten anywhere, but trash must be carried out. Parking near the entry is for staff only.

# Article 作业

In today’s digital age, stories are accessible in various ways, including reading and listening. While some prefer the convenience of audio stories, others, including myself, believe reading books offers greater benefits.

First, reading significantly improves vocabulary. Seeing words visually helps learners grasp spelling, usage, and context, which is crucial for language development. Strong vocabulary enhances performance in exams, communication, and writing key skills for students.

Second, reading is environmentally friendly. Physical books require no energy to operate and produce no carbon emissions. As some classmates noted, swapping books extends their lifespan, reducing paper waste. This practice promotes sustainability while fostering a culture of sharing.

In conclusion, reading stories enriches minds and protects the planet, making it the superior choice. Let’s cherish books and their timeless value.
