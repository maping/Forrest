In today’s digital age, stories are accessible in various ways, including reading and listening. While some prefer the convenience of audio stories, others, including myself, believe reading books offers greater benefits.

First, reading significantly improves vocabulary. Seeing words visually helps learners grasp spelling, usage, and context, which is crucial for language development. Strong vocabulary enhances performance in exams, communication, and writing key skills for students.

Second, reading is environmentally friendly. Physical books require no energy to operate and produce no carbon emissions. As some classmates noted, swapping books extends their lifespan, reducing paper waste. This practice promotes sustainability while fostering a culture of sharing.

In conclusion, reading stories enriches minds and protects the planet, making it the superior choice. Let’s cherish books and their timeless value.
