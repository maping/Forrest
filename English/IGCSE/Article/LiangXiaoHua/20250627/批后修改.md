**Wim Hof – ‘the iceman’**

Wim Hof, born in 1959 in the Netherlands, is known as ‘the iceman’ for a very good reason. He has an unusual ability, which is simply that he doesn’t feel cold at all, even in very low temperatures. Scientists say that what he is capable of should be impossible.

What exactly can Hof do? By the time he was a teenager, he could easily run in the snow without shoes on. This was the first of many achievements which have surprised doctors and scientists. But he says that anyone can learn to do what he is capable of – the key to success is to concentrate on what you are doing. Over time, Hof has developed a method which he claims is not at all complicated to follow.

The body temperature of a ‘normal’ person would drop dangerously if they spent much time in extremely cold temperatures. But Hof broke a world record by sitting in a large container full of ice for 1 hour and 52 minutes, and throughout this time his body temperature remained the same. This is not the only amazing thing he has done. He has swum under ice in a lake for 120 metres, without taking a breath. He has also run a marathon in the Arctic, wearing only shorts and sandals. And, in the same clothes, he has climbed almost to the top of Mount Everest.

Most people would not want to try to do the things that Hof has achieved, but some do. He now teaches people how to cope with extreme cold. The first thing to learn is to control your breathing. He has developed special exercises which help you to do this. After that, he says you should gradually get used to the cold – for example, you can start by standing under a cold shower for a few seconds. While you are doing this, you should relax and enjoy the experience because, as Hof says, ‘the cold is your friend!’

**Salary Matters Most in Career Choice**

When choosing a job, salary should be the main concern. While some argue money can't buy happiness or prefer learning opportunities, I believe financial stability is essential for a secure future.

Firstly, there is no doubt that financial stability is a key factor when choosing a job. A sufficient income ensures a comfortable lifestyle, covering basic needs and future security. Without financial stability, even passion for work may fade under the pressure of economic stress.

Secondly, a higher salary motivates employees to work harder. When efforts are rewarded financially, job satisfaction and productivity increase. This creates a positive cycle where both the employee and the employer benefit.

In conclusion, although some people prioritize learning opportunities or personal fulfillment, I believe that salary remains the most important consideration. Financial stability and motivation are irreplaceable. Therefore, when choosing a career, salary should be a top priority.

**Salary Matters Most in Career Choice**

As graduation approaches, many students face a crucial question. Whether they should prioritize salary when choosing future careers.While some argue money cannot buy happiness or prefer learning opportunities, others believe that salary is always important than anything else. In my opinion, financial stability is essential for a secure life.

Firstly, a higher salary motivates employees to work harder. Studies have shown that financial incentives may directly impact employee performance as seen in companies that offer performance-based bonuses. When employees are fairly compensated for their efforts, they are more likely to feel valued, stay engaged, and remain productive. This not only benefits the individual but also contributes to the company's success, fostering a rewarding working environment.

A stable and high income provide a sense of security, covers essential expenses, and avoids financial stress.Without sufficient earnings, even fulfilling jobs may become stressful if it fails to meet basic financial needs.For example, people with higher incomes are better able to afford healthcare, education, and emergency savings, reducing stress and improving overall well-being.Therefore, prioritizing salary ensures that one can build a stable future while maintaining a good quality of life.

In conclusion, although some people prioritize learning opportunities or personal fulfillment, I believe that salary remains the most important consideration. Financial stability and motivation are irreplaceable. Therefore, when choosing a career, salary should be a top priority.
