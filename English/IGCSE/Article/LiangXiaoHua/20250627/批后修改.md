**Wim Hof – ‘the iceman’**

Wim Hof, born in 1959 in the Netherlands, is known as ‘the iceman’ for a very good reason. He has an unusual ability, which is simply that he doesn’t feel cold at all, even in very low temperatures. Scientists say that what he is capable of should be impossible.

What exactly can Hof do? By the time he was a teenager, he could easily run in the snow without shoes on. This was the first of many achievements which have surprised doctors and scientists. But he says that anyone can learn to do what he is capable of – the key to success is to concentrate on what you are doing. Over time, Hof has developed a method which he claims is not at all complicated to follow.

The body temperature of a ‘normal’ person would drop dangerously if they spent much time in extremely cold temperatures. But Hof broke a world record by sitting in a large container full of ice for 1 hour and 52 minutes, and throughout this time his body temperature remained the same. This is not the only amazing thing he has done. He has swum under ice in a lake for 120 metres, without taking a breath. He has also run a marathon in the Arctic, wearing only shorts and sandals. And, in the same clothes, he has climbed almost to the top of Mount Everest.

Most people would not want to try to do the things that Hof has achieved, but some do. He now teaches people how to cope with extreme cold. The first thing to learn is to control your breathing. He has developed special exercises which help you to do this. After that, he says you should gradually get used to the cold – for example, you can start by standing under a cold shower for a few seconds. While you are doing this, you should relax and enjoy the experience because, as Hof says, ‘the cold is your friend!’
