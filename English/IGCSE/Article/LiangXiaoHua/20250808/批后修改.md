Your school/college is preparing a project about keeping animals in zoos.

Here are some comments from your friends on this topic:
- “Most people have the chance to see endangered species in our zoos.”
- “Animals were born to be free and live naturally.”
- “We can study their behaviour better in captivity.”
- “No animals are happy in a cage.”

Your teacher has asked you to write an article giving your views about the issue.

Your article should be about 100-150 words long.

The comments above may give you some ideas but you are free to use any ideas of your own.

You will receive up to 5 marks for the content of your article, and up to 5 marks for the style and accuracy of your language.
