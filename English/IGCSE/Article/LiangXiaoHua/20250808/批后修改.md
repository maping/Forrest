Almond milk

Look inside a supermarket shopping trolley and you may well see a bottle or carton of non-dairy milk – a drink that has been produced from something other than cows’ milk. There’s been a huge increase in these alternatives to regular cows’ milk. They’re made of water and finely blended nuts, beans or grains, including rice, soy and almond. The latter, compared with milk made from things like soy, has a lighter flavour, which many people prefer. This makes it one of the most popular milk substitutes.

Almonds in their natural form are very good for you. However, people are often surprised to find that many brands of almond milk contain only about 2% almonds. And while it’s good to know that there is less sugar in almond milk than in cows’ milk, there is also less protein, which is needed for building muscles and repairing the body’s cells. Almond milk is very low in cholesterol, a substance which can lead to heart problems, giving people another reason to switch to almond milk.

Many of the almonds that are destined for milk production are grown on large farms in California, an area that experiences periods of drought. When we consider that it takes around an astonishing 5 litres of water to grow one almond, the issues caused by almond milk and its production become obvious. What is more, almond trees are often treated with chemicals, and these can have a damaging effect on the local wildlife. Despite these concerns, almond milk remains popular. And the fact that it doesn’t need to be kept in a fridge before opening makes it a convenient choice for many.

Almond milk, a popular dairy alternative, offers benefits such as a light flavor, low cholesterol, and less sugar than cow’s milk. However, it contains minimal protein and only about 2% almonds in many brands. Environmentally, almond production requires excessive water—5 liters per almond—posing issues in drought-prone regions like California. Additionally, chemical treatments for almond trees harm local wildlife. Despite these drawbacks, its convenience q32and health advantages sustain its popularity.

Your school/college is preparing a project about keeping animals in zoos.

Here are some comments from your friends on this topic:
- “Most people have the chance to see endangered species in our zoos.”
- “Animals were born to be free and live naturally.”
- “We can study their behaviour better in captivity.”
- “No animals are happy in a cage.”

Your teacher has asked you to write an article giving your views about the issue.

Your article should be about 100-150 words long.

The comments above may give you some ideas but you are free to use any ideas of your own.

Why Zoos Are Essential for Conservation and Education ？

In recent years, zoo visits have become increasingly popular worldwide, sparking heated debates about animal captivity. While some view zoos as necessary conservation centers, others consider them cruel prisons for wildlife. In my opinion, properly managed zoos provide significant benefits that justify their existence.

Firstly, zoos play a vital role in protecting endangered species. Many animals face extinction due to habitat loss and poaching. Zoos provide safe environments where these vulnerable species can breed and recover. The giant panda's conservation success story proves this - through dedicated breeding programs in zoos and research bases, their status improved from "endangered" to "vulnerable". Without zoos, such remarkable recoveries would be impossible.

Secondly, zoos serve as powerful educational tools. They allow scientists to conduct crucial research on animal behavior and health, leading to better conservation strategies. For visitors, seeing animals firsthand creates emotional connections that inspire wildlife protection efforts. Educational programs in zoos teach children about biodiversity and ecosystems in ways that classrooms simply cannot match.

In conclusion, while animal freedom concerns are valid, the conservation and educational benefits of well-managed zoos are too valuable to ignore. Instead of abolishing zoos, we should focus on improving animal welfare standards to ensure they serve as true sanctuaries for wildlife protection and education.
