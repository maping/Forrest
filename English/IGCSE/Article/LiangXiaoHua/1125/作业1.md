Homework has always been a topic of debate in schools. While some argue that it is an essential tool for reinforcing what we learn in class, others believe it takes up too much of their free time.
On one hand, homework allows students to review and practice what they’ve learned, which can help them understand the material better. As some of my classmates have pointed out, they sometimes find it easier to focus and learn at home, where there are fewer distractions than in the classroom.
However, many students feel that the amount of homework they receive is overwhelming. They argue that it consumes too much of their free time, leaving them with little opportunity to relax or pursue other interests. Moreover, some students feel that they would rather stay longer at school to complete tasks, rather than spending hours at home.
In my opinion, homework should be balanced. While it is important for reinforcing knowledge, it should not overwhelm students or take away from their personal time.
