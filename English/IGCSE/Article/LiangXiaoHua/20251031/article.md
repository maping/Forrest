Technology Helps Students Get Better Grades

In recent years, technology has become an essential part of education. ② Some argue that technology can distract people from studying, while others agree that it can assist students in different subjects. In my opinion, when used wisely, technology significantly improves grades by making learning more engaging and flexible and by empowering students to solve problems independently.

Firstly, technology makes learning more entertaining, fun, and flexible. Online tools such as Kahoot, Quizlet, and Google
Classroom allow students to join games, take quick quizzes, and review lessons in enjoyable ways. These interactive activities make learning more engaging and help students stay focused and participate more actively in class. In addition to being fun, technology also makes learning more flexible. When we can review lessons anytime and get feedback from teachers online, we can manage our study time better and learn at our own pace. Therefore, these benefits help students understand topics more effectively and achieve better grades.

Secondly, technology gives students more ways to solve problems. When teachers are busy, students can use Artificial
Intelligence (AI) learning tools such as ChatGPT or websites like Khan Academy to find explanations and learn new methods. These tools provide instant feedback and step-by-step guidance, so students can understand difficult topics without waiting for help from teachers. In this way, AI encourages students to take responsibility for their own learning and become more
independent.

In conclusion, technology is a powerful tool for learning. If we use it carefully and responsibly, it can make studying easier and help us do better in school.
