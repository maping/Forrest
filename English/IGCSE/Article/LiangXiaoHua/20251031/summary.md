To be good at telling jokes, you need confidence and practice. Believe in your joke and pause before the punchline to make it funnier. Think about who your audience is and choose jokes that match their sense of humour. Use your voice in different ways——sometimes louder or softer to make your joke sound lively. Make eye contact with your listeners and stay relaxed. Do not laugh once you complete your joke. The more you practise, the more confident and natural you become as a speaker.
