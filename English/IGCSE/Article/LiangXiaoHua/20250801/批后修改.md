Not All Teenagers Should Be Forced to Exercise

Nowadays, many people believe that teenagers should develop good habits early, and one common suggestion is doing regular exercise. Some argue that exercising is fun and helps improve our health, while others believe it is too expensive or that some teenagers don’t have time or the ability to do it. In my opinion, not all teenagers should be forced to exercise because some are not physically or mentally fit for it, and others may not enjoy it due to their personality.

Firstly, not all teenagers are physically or mentally suitable for doing exercise.Some teenagers may have health problems such as asthma, joint pain, or injuries, which make physical activity difficult or even dangerous. Others may have low confidence or mental health issues, making it stressful to join group sports or participate in physical activities.For example, a student with anxiety might feel overwhelmed in PE class or during team sports, which could harm their mental health instead of helping them.Therefore, making all teenagers do exercise can lead to more harm than benefit for some individuals.

Secondly, not every teenager has the kind of personality that enjoys physical activities.Some teenagers may prefer calm, creative activities such as painting, reading, or playing an instrument. Forcing them to do sports may feel like a punishment and lead to dislike or resistance.For instance, a shy and introverted teen may feel very uncomfortable when asked to play in a noisy, competitive environment like a basketball match.So, instead of requiring everyone to exercise, schools should offer more choices that suit different interests and personalities.

In conclusion, while exercise has many benefits, it should not be compulsory for every teenager. Health conditions, mental well-being, and personality differences should all be considered. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle is important, but it should allow for flexibility and personal choice.
