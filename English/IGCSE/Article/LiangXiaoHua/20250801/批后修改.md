Learning to Sail


Have you ever been on a sailing boat? If so, then you’ll know what fun it can be! Did you know that sailing’s included on the training courses of some professions – not necessarily ones connected with the water? That’s because learning to sail offers an all-round learning experience. For example, when you’re learning to sail, you must make choices quickly about what to do next. This is an important ability in other areas of life too.

Sailing is very much a team activity. Each crew member has a job to do, and it is essential that everyone learns to work well together. However, there isn’t always time for discussion as weather conditions at sea can change without warning. If you’re the person in charge, then communicating instructions clearly is vital. You might not find this easy, but you should keep trying. If you don’t, you risk confusing your crew, and that causes problems. This is what’s involved in being a good leader. It’s not a role that feels natural to everyone, but it’s something that can be developed, and learning to take charge of a boat is a great place to do this.

Sailing can be great fun, but sometimes things can go wrong. It’s therefore crucial that all the safety equipment is working. If you’re responsible for these checks, you must be completely focused on what you are doing and avoid distractions until you’ve finished. It could make all the difference in an emergency.

If you’re on a boat with more experienced sailors, watch how they move the sails to catch the wind and vary speed. Listen carefully to what they tell you, as learning to take advice from people who know more than you is always useful.

When you sail regularly with a crew, you’re likely to see an increase in your ability to complete several tasks at the same time. You might be pulling ropes while checking sails and confirming your position. This isn’t straightforward, but it’s a great way of helping you to trust in yourself, and is of huge benefit to sailors.

Not All Teenagers Should Be Forced to Exercise

Nowadays, many people believe that teenagers should develop good habits early, and one common suggestion is doing regular exercise. Some argue that exercising is fun and helps improve our health, while others believe it is too expensive or that some teenagers don’t have time or the ability to do it. In my opinion, not all teenagers should be forced to exercise because some are not physically or mentally fit for it, and others may not enjoy it due to their personality.

Firstly, not all teenagers are physically or mentally suitable for doing exercise.Some teenagers may have health problems such as asthma, joint pain, or injuries, which make physical activity difficult or even dangerous. Others may have low confidence or mental health issues, making it stressful to join group sports or participate in physical activities.For example, a student with anxiety might feel overwhelmed in PE class or during team sports, which could harm their mental health instead of helping them.Therefore, making all teenagers do exercise can lead to more harm than benefit for some individuals.

Secondly, not every teenager has the kind of personality that enjoys physical activities.Some teenagers may prefer calm, creative activities such as painting, reading, or playing an instrument. Forcing them to do sports may feel like a punishment and lead to dislike or resistance.For instance, a shy and introverted teen may feel very uncomfortable when asked to play in a noisy, competitive environment like a basketball match.So, instead of requiring everyone to exercise, schools should offer more choices that suit different interests and personalities.

In conclusion, while exercise has many benefits, it should not be compulsory for every teenager. Health conditions, mental well-being, and personality differences should all be considered. Encouraging a healthy lifestyle is important, but it should allow for flexibility and personal choice.
