The Greater Influence of Family on Personal Success

Our class discussed whether family or school impacts success more. Some classmates said school only teaches exam skills, while others valued parents' life lessons. In my opinion family influence is more significant.

First, family teaches us the core value that shapes who we will become. At home, we learn kindness through our parents’ action.In addition to watching them manage struggle and fulfill responsibility from daily chores,we iunternalise these qualities and these life lesson from our character long before we step into classroom which helps us develop emotional intelligence and resilience.For instance, the advice from parents about treating others with respect guides us far more effectively than any textbook lessons.

Second, although school provides valuable knowledge, it is our family’s support that helps us apply it.When students feel overwhelmed by school pressure,it is pur parents who teach us to persevere.THey help us turn academic ito real-world wisdom.For example on math classes teacher teach students equations, parents show how to budget money,when students stress about exams, family support helps them persevere,this is more effective than psychology classes.

In conclusion, although school provides important knowledge,family teaches us how to use it in life. Values like resilience and practical wisdom from home ultimately determine long-term success more than exam results.

I suggest you write a proposal on environmental protection. You could focus on daily actions like reducing plastic use, recycling waste, saving electricity, or organizing a tree-planting event in your local community. These actions are easy to carry out but can have a lasting impact.

I believe this is a great topic because environmental problems like global warming, air pollution, and waste are getting worse. As teenagers, we have the power to influence others and raise awareness. Your proposal can encourage more young people to take part in protecting our planet. If everyone does a little, we can make a big difference together.
