**Trams**

If you live in a city, you're likely to spend many hours each year sitting in traffic jams. This can be a major problem, and one way of tackling it is to encourage people to use cars less by improving public transport. Cities worldwide are trying to provide better bus and train services, but many also want to extend their tram systems or introduce new ones. However, as with railways, constructing a tram system takes considerable time. So, why build a tram system?

One important point is that trams cause very little pollution because they run on electricity. At a time when environmental damage and climate change are serious issues, this is a major consideration. Another clear benefit is that tram tracks are cheaper to build than railway lines, although most experts agree that towns and cities need railways and underground systems as well.

Many cities around the world have had trams since the 19th century. In the Australian city of Melbourne, for example, they were first introduced in 1884, and there are now 24 tram routes and over 250 kilometres of track in the city. Robert Clayton, a Melbourne transport expert, says that the city council considered closing the system in the 1980s. "But fortunately they dropped those plans," says Clayton. "We're lucky. Melbourne streets are mostly wide and we don't have the problem which some cities with narrow streets have. In those places, other traffic gets stuck behind trams ‚Äì there's not enough space to drive around them."

Clayton explains that because tram tracks are fixed, people know that a tram route will never change. "It's not the same with buses," he says. "Their routes get changed from time to time for various reasons. And although trams are noisier than buses, people here say they're more comfortable for passengers to ride in. After all, isn't that one of the most important things?"

## Summary ‰Ωú‰∏ö
Trams are beneficial because they run on electricity, causing less pollution, and are cheaper to build than railways. They also offer predictable routes, which helps commuters plan travel better. In cities with wide roads like Melbourne, trams work well. However, construction takes time, and in places with narrow streets, trams can block other vehicles. Also, trams are noisier than buses. Still, many passengers find them more comfortable, which makes them a valuable part of urban transport systems.

Tram systems offer several advantages, including reduced pollution as they run on electricity, making them environmentally friendly. They also provide a reliable and comfortable mode of transport, with fixed routes ensuring consistency. Additionally, tram tracks are cheaper to build than railway lines. However, constructing tram systems is time-consuming, and in cities with narrow streets, trams can cause traffic congestion by blocking other vehicles. Unlike buses, tram routes cannot be easily adjusted, which may limit flexibility. Despite these drawbacks, trams remain an efficient public transport solution for many cities.
