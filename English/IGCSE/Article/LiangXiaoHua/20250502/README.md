**Trams**

If you live in a city, you're likely to spend many hours each year sitting in traffic jams. This can be a major problem, and one way of tackling it is to encourage people to use cars less by improving public transport. Cities worldwide are trying to provide better bus and train services, but many also want to extend their tram systems or introduce new ones. However, as with railways, constructing a tram system takes considerable time. So, why build a tram system?

One important point is that trams cause very little pollution because they run on electricity. At a time when environmental damage and climate change are serious issues, this is a major consideration. Another clear benefit is that tram tracks are cheaper to build than railway lines, although most experts agree that towns and cities need railways and underground systems as well.

Many cities around the world have had trams since the 19th century. In the Australian city of Melbourne, for example, they were first introduced in 1884, and there are now 24 tram routes and over 250 kilometres of track in the city. Robert Clayton, a Melbourne transport expert, says that the city council considered closing the system in the 1980s. "But fortunately they dropped those plans," says Clayton. "We're lucky. Melbourne streets are mostly wide and we don't have the problem which some cities with narrow streets have. In those places, other traffic gets stuck behind trams – there's not enough space to drive around them."

Clayton explains that because tram tracks are fixed, people know that a tram route will never change. "It's not the same with buses," he says. "Their routes get changed from time to time for various reasons. And although trams are noisier than buses, people here say they're more comfortable for passengers to ride in. After all, isn't that one of the most important things?"

Should Boys and Girls Attend Separate Schools?

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about whether boys and girls aged 14–18 should attend separate schools. Some people believe it helps with focus and improves behaviour, while others think it’s important for both genders to learn how to understand each other. From my perspective, boys and girls should go to mixed-gender schools. 

First of all, studying together helps students develop social skills. In the future, they will need to work with people of different genders, so it’s better to start learning how to communicate early.

Secondly, having both boys and girls in one school can create healthy competition. This can motivate students to work harder and do their best.

In conclusion, mixed schools help students grow both academically and socially. It prepares them better for real life.

From my perspective, boys and girls should go to mixed-gender schools. 

Socially, studying together helps students develop social skills. In the future, they will need to work with people of different genders, so it is beneficial to start learning how to communicate effectively from a young age.

Academically, having both boys and girls in one school can encourage healthy competition. In school, such competition plays a vital role by teaching students how to set goals, handle pressure, and persevere through challenges, which motivates students to work harder and do their best.

In conclusion, mixed schools help students grow both socially and academically which fosters essential competencies for real-world situations.

The idea of separating boys and girls in schools has both advantages and disadvantages. Some argue that single-sex schools improve concentration and behavior, as there are fewer distractions. Competition between genders might also motivate students to work harder.

However, I believe mixed schools are more beneficial. In real life, men and women work together, so learning to communicate and understand each other from a young age is essential. Mixed schools teach social skills, respect, and teamwork, preparing students for future workplaces and relationships. While distractions can happen, they are part of growing up and learning self-discipline.

In conclusion, mixed schools provide a balanced environment where students can excel academically while developing crucial life skills. Separation might solve some problems but could create others, like difficulty in future social interactions.
