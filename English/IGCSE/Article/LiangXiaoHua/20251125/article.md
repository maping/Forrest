Freedom Helps Children Grow‌

Nowadays, in children's development, the question of how their mistakes should be handled is often discussed. Options are divided on whether children should be allowed to make mistakes. Some students hold their opinions that freedom helps children grow, while others argue that if parents completely let children do things on their own, they may get hurt. In my opinion, I believe children should be allowed to make mistakes under adults' guidance. 

Firstly, when children are allowed to make small decisions, they learn to take responsibility for their actions. This builds problem-solving skills and teaches them to think ahead. For example, when children forget to bring their homework, they will have to face the consequences, such as a lower grade or having to complete it during break time. This natural consequence is a more powerful teacher than a parent's reminder. Over time, these minor mistakes shape them into more mature and thoughtful individuals.

Secondly, while this autonomy is crucial, it must be exercised within a framework of safety provided by adults. Some risks are too dangerous for them to judge by their own. For example, when children crossing a busy road, playing near deep water, or using sharp tools, they are exposed to unacceptable risks. In these situations, adults must step in and give some guidance.

In conclusion, children need both freedom and protection. Seeking a balance between the two is critical for their growth.
