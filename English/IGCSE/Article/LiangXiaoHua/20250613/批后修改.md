**A future football star**

Remember the name Jesse Sulbaran. Soon you might see him scoring a goal in the World Cup, or advertising a famous brand of football boots. But for now, this 16-year-old is one of the few lucky players to have a place at the National Football Academy.

The Academy is a training school for talented young players, and Jesse has been there since he was eleven. Life there is tough – students have to work as hard on their academic studies as on their football skills, and aren’t allowed to play football if their schoolwork isn’t good enough. Jesse admits it’s demanding, but says it has taught him to try his best in everything he does. The schedule is always packed, not just with football, but with other responsibilities around the Academy, so Jesse has had to train himself to manage his time effectively.

Jesse’s weekly routine involves three sessions of football training, a regular fitness programme, and matches against other youth teams, as well as schoolwork of course. Last year, he was chosen for international matches, which he believes has helped him to adapt to different styles of football. The Academy aims to give pupils a broader education than simply football, so all students are encouraged to take up a new sport in the first term. In addition to lessons on how to handle media interviews, the curriculum also includes information to help players maintain a healthy diet, which Jesse says he found useful.

Such a demanding timetable is bound to bring challenges. Jesse recently hurt his ankle during a match and wasn’t able to play for a month. He describes his disappointment, but says the doctors were fantastic and showed him how to recover from injuries in a safe way. Every year, the club decides who will continue at the Academy, and only the best players make it through. ‘We’re always under huge pressure, so you’ve got to keep a positive mental attitude. The coaches spend a lot of time helping us with this, and for me this is one of the most useful skills I’ve gained.’

# Article 作业
Write an article for a teenage magazine persuading young people to take care of their environment, offering ideas and advice on how to do this.

The comments below may give you some ideas, but you are free to use any ideas of your own.

Your article should be about 200 words long.

- People should share cars on their way to work – often I see queues of cars in the morning with only one person in each!
- We need a car each in our family – we all work and study in different directions.
- It is easy to recycle glass, plastic, paper, and batteries, and it helps!
- I have no time to recycle – it is much quicker just to throw everything away.
- We can use alternative energy sources nowadays – solar panels on our roof, for example.

Simple Steps to Save Our Planet

Our planet is facing unprecedented environmental challenges, and it’s up to us, the younger generation, to take action. While it may seem overwhelming, small changes in our daily lives can make a significant difference. By adopting sustainable practices like using alternative energy, reducing waste, and making eco-friendly transportation choices, we can protect the environment and ensure a brighter future for all.  
 
One impactful way to care for the environment is by embracing alternative energy sources. Fossil fuels are a major contributor to pollution and climate change, but we now have cleaner options. For instance, installing solar panels on rooftops or supporting wind energy projects can drastically reduce our reliance on harmful energy sources. Even small steps, like using energy-efficient appliances, help conserve resources and lower carbon emissions.  

Another essential practice is reducing waste through recycling and mindful consumption. Items like glass, plastic, paper, and batteries can often be recycled rather than thrown away. While it may seem easier to discard everything, taking a little extra time to separate recyclables ensures these materials are reused, reducing landfill waste and conserving natural resources. Every recycled item is a step toward a healthier planet.  

In conclusion, safeguarding the environment requires collective effort and conscious choices. By turning to alternative energy, recycling diligently, and adopting sustainable habits, we can significantly lessen our ecological footprint. Let’s act now—our planet’s future depends on the steps we take today.

Even small steps, like using energy-efficient appliances, help conserve resources and lower carbon emissions.  

Another essential practice is reducing waste through recycling. Keeping a separate bin for bottles, paper and cans takes minimal time. Schools and parks often have recycling stations, making it convenient to dispose of items properly. Even recycling just one type of material, like plastic bottles, contributes to reducing waste. Small consistent actions create meaningful change.

In conclusion, safeguarding the environment requires collective effort and conscious choices. By turning to alternative energy, recycling diligently, and adopting sustainable habits, we can significantly lessen our ecological footprint. Let’s act now—our planet’s future depends on the steps we take today.

For instance, installing solar panels on rooftops or supporting wind energy projects can drastically reduce our reliance on harmful energy sources. Even small steps, like using renewable energy sources, help conserve resources and lower carbon emissions.

Another essential practice is being mindful of what we buy, which helps the planet. Many products create waste through packaging and manufacturing. We should choose second-hand items, avoid disposable products, and repair things instead of replacing them. Small choices mentioned above reduce waste and encourage companies to adopt more eco-friendly practices.

In conclusion protecting the environment requires collective action. By using alternative energy, buying smart, and wasting less, we can significantly lessen our ecological footprint, and therefore protect our planet. Our planet’s future depends on the steps we take today.
