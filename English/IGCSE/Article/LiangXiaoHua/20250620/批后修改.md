The Arctic World Archive is a highly secure data storage facility located on a remote island between Norway and the North Pole, 300 meters underground. Its stable temperature eliminates the need for energy-consuming climate control, and its isolated location ensures minimal risk of unauthorized access. Data is stored on durable digital film that lasts 500 years and cannot be altered. Although retrieval is not instant—requiring physical collection and secure transfer—this offline method provides unparalleled protection against cyber threats, making it a reliable solution for safeguarding valuable information.
