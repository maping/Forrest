**Keeping your data safe: the Arctic World Archive**

Nowadays, we all keep a huge amount of information on our computers and phones, like electronic messages and photos. If you’ve ever lost important information from your computer, or your phone, you’ll know how annoying this can be! Nowadays, however, governments, businesses and people who are concerned about losing valuable data or photos can relax a bit more. There is a large data storage facility, called the Arctic World Archive, which opened in March 2017.

The archive is found on an island between mainland Norway and the North Pole. It is 300 metres below the ground, and protected from the Arctic conditions above. The temperature underground does not vary a great deal, and this makes it suitable for storing data securely. The fact that no extra energy is needed to maintain the temperature means there is no need for temperature control equipment. And because the island is in a very remote location, it is unlikely that anyone would try to access it.

A company has developed the technology to store people’s data by transferring it onto special digital film which lasts 500 years. This is considerably longer than some other methods of data storage. The data on this digital film cannot be edited in any way by anyone. People wanting to use the archive send data to the company, and once it is stored, they can ask to get it back at any time. This is not an immediate process though. For extra security, the data held in the archive is not connected to the internet. When a request for stored information is made, staff at the archive have to go and physically collect the relevant digital film. This is then sent electronically using a special safe cable which is connected to the mainland. This procedure can take half an hour or more. But in these days of online security problems around the world, this is well worth the wait!

The Arctic World Archive is a highly secure data storage facility located on a remote island between Norway and the North Pole, 300 meters underground. Its stable temperature eliminates the need for energy-consuming climate control, and its isolated location ensures minimal risk of unauthorized access. Data is stored on durable digital film that lasts 500 years and cannot be altered. Although retrieval is not instant—requiring physical collection and secure transfer—this offline method provides unparalleled protection against cyber threats, making it a reliable solution for safeguarding valuable information.

# Article 作业
Your class recently visited a museum, and your teacher led a discussion about whether museums should serve as places to entertain visitors or to educate people.

In your article, write about your views on the functions of museums.

Here are some comments from students in your class:
- I think learning is the most important part.
- It’s boring when museums just have too many facts and no fun stuff.
- I like museums that have more things that are just fun to explore.
- I love it when museums have hands-on activities to make learning more exciting.

Now write an article for the school magazine, giving your views.

The comments above may give you some ideas, and you should also use some ideas of your own.

Write about 120 to 160 words.

You will receive up to 6 marks for the content of your article and up to 9 marks for the language used.

Museums: Where Education Meets Engagement

Museums serve as bridges between knowledge and experience, offering visitors opportunities to learn in engaging ways. While some argue they should focus on education and others prefer entertainment, the most effective museums combine both functions.

First, museums provide direct encounters with history that textbooks cannot match. At geological museums, visitors can touch real 100-million-year-old fossils, making ancient history tangible. This hands-on experience creates deeper understanding than passive reading. Seeing authentic artifacts up close brings textbook descriptions to life in unforgettable ways.

Second, museums connect classroom lessons to real-world applications. Science centers with interactive physics exhibits or historical museums with replica artifacts allow students to apply theoretical knowledge. These practical experiences reinforce learning while making it more enjoyable. When students operate earthquake simulators or examine ancient tools, abstract concepts become concrete.

In conclusion, museums fulfill their highest purpose when they balance education and engagement. By presenting authentic artifacts alongside interactive displays, they both inform and inspire visitors. This dual approach ensures museums remain relevant and valuable in our modern world.

In geological museums, for example, visitors can touch real fossils over 100 million years old. This hands-on experience creates deeper understanding than passive reading.

Second, museums connect classroom lessons to real-world applications.Practical experiences reinforce learning while making it more enjoyable. Science centers with interactive physics exhibits or historical museums with replica artifacts allow students to apply abstract knowledge in practical settings. These practical experiences reinforce learning while making it more enjoyable. Besides, when students operate earthquake simulators or examine ancient tools, abstract concepts become concrete.

In conclusion, museums fulfill their highest purpose when they balance education and engagement.By presenting authentic artifacts alongside interactive displays, they not only inform but also inspire visitors.
