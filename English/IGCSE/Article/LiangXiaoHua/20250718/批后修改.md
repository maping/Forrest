The Greater Influence on Success: Family or School

The debate over whether family or school has a greater impact on future success is important. While school teaches skills for exams, family values shape our character and resilience.

First, family teaches core values that define who we are. Parents lead by example—showing kindness, responsibility, and respect. These lessons build emotional intelligence before we even enter school. For instance, a parent’s advice on treating others well stays with us longer than textbook knowledge.

Second, school provides knowledge, but family helps us use it. When students feel overwhelmed by exams, parents encourage perseverance. They turn math into budgeting skills or history into life lessons, making education practical.

In conclusion, school prepares us for tests, but family prepares us for life. Both matter, but values from home influence success most.
