The Greater Influence on Success: Family or School

Our class debated whether family or school impacts success more. Some said school only teaches exam skills, while others valued parents' life lessons. I believe family influence matters most.  

First, family shapes our core character. Parents model values like kindness and responsibility daily. When children see parents helping neighbors, they learn compassion better than from any textbook. These lessons build emotional intelligence that schools rarely teach.  

Second, family makes school knowledge practical.While math classes teach equations, parents show how to budget money. When students stress about exams, family support helps them persevere. This turns abstract learning into real-world skills.  

Though school provides important knowledge, family teaches us how to use it in life. Values like resilience and practical wisdom from home ultimately determine long-term success more than exam results.
