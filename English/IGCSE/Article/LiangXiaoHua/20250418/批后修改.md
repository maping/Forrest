**Adventure in the trees**

I loved climbing trees as a child, so for my birthday last weekend my friends knew exactly where to take me – a day out to Treetop World! The only way to describe Treetop World is an adventure park high in the forest. You experience climbing and swinging across the treetops on ropes and ladders, all in a safe environment with expert guides to help.

Our tickets were booked for 14:00, but I’d definitely recommend arriving early. This is a good idea as you can watch the people already climbing high in the trees. It looked a bit scary but lots of fun, although one man dropped his phone onto the ground below. Obviously, it’s a good idea to put your belongings into a zipped pocket! And if possible leave anything valuable at home.

At 14:00 our guide, Jed, gave us our safety talk, which everyone has to attend. It included some useful tips. He made the talk entertaining, and when I was up in the trees feeling slightly nervous, I was glad I remembered what he’d said. So listen carefully to your guide – you won’t regret it.

To get up in the trees, we had to climb a 150-metre ladder to the first platform. I was chosen as the first person to swing across to the next branch. I felt unsure, but took a deep breath and stepped forwards. Suddenly I was rushing through the air like a bird, landing safely at the next tree. I loved it!

The course is easy at first and gets more challenging, but my confidence increased as I got used to the equipment. Guides monitor you from the forest floor, so if you get a little scared or have a question, just ask them for help.

After two hours swinging in the trees, we were covered in dust! One thing I’d suggest is wearing clothes you don’t mind getting dirty. And the park remains open even in the rain, so you might want to bring a waterproof jacket. We returned home after a great day out, feeling exhausted but very happy!

Should Boys and Girls Attend Separate Schools?

Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about whether boys and girls aged 14–18 should attend separate schools. Some people believe it helps with focus and improves behaviour, while others think it’s important for both genders to learn how to understand each other. From my perspective, boys and girls should go to mixed-gender schools. 

First of all, studying together helps students develop social skills. In the future, they will need to work with people of different genders, so it’s better to start learning how to communicate early.

Secondly, having both boys and girls in one school can create healthy competition. This can motivate students to work harder and do their best.

In conclusion, mixed schools help students grow both academically and socially. It prepares them better for real life.

The idea of separating boys and girls in schools has both advantages and disadvantages. Some argue that single-sex schools improve concentration and behavior, as there are fewer distractions. Competition between genders might also motivate students to work harder.

However, I believe mixed schools are more beneficial. In real life, men and women work together, so learning to communicate and understand each other from a young age is essential. Mixed schools teach social skills, respect, and teamwork, preparing students for future workplaces and relationships. While distractions can happen, they are part of growing up and learning self-discipline.

In conclusion, mixed schools provide a balanced environment where students can excel academically while developing crucial life skills. Separation might solve some problems but could create others, like difficulty in future social interactions.
