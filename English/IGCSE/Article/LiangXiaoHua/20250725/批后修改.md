Game On

I work in a primary school, where I teach music and mathematics to students aged five to ten. Although I knew very little about sport, I was recently asked to coach the children in the football team. Fortunately, I heard about a new opportunity for people like myself. It is called the “Premier Skills Project”, and its purpose is to help new sports coaches to learn valuable skills to teach young children to play football, or soccer as it is called in many parts of the world.

My experience with children’s football was limited and so I really wanted to improve my ability as a coach. At the time, football was not well developed for the pupils in my school. Many of them did not even know that they had to kick the ball. I remember one child picking up the ball and running away with it. Sometimes they would try to hit the ball with their hands or punch it with their fists. They even let it strike them in the face or on the nose – with the result that the school medical room was kept very busy! Some children often refused to play at all because they just didn’t know what to do. I needed to learn how to help them understand the game so that they got better at playing it. Through this new project, I hoped to discover how to deliver the basic skills of soccer to young people who had never even kicked a ball.

I am often asked what I learnt on the “Premier Skills Project” training course I attended and how I am now applying this in my job as a coach. I reply that I learnt how to deal with young players, and what appropriate activities to give them. I learnt many training skills and now know what to do at each stage of training. The most important lesson is that children need to enjoy the game and to have fun while they are playing it.

Nowadays, I always try to keep the focus on enjoyment. Even when we lose a match, we still return home happy. I have come to realise that young children do not like being shouted at, so now I walk over to them and speak to them without raising my voice. As a result, I am a much better organised coach. Even when I am not present, everything can be done because I list all the activities in my session plan. I try to keep everyone involved, and my coaching has become interactive. I encourage the players to lead some of the training activities, so I can focus on the interests and abilities of individual boys and girls.

The children too are more respectful to each other. They do not argue as much as they used to. They are better organised now. They plan ahead for their school day and try to make time for their soccer training. They are much better at making friends and have therefore become popular members of their communities.

# Article 作业
Some students take a year off after finishing school and before starting university. This is a 'gap year'.

Write an article for your school magazine discussing the advantages and disadvantages of a gap year.

The comments below may give you some ideas, but you are free to use any ideas of your own.
- "It is good to see the world before beginning more intensive studying."
- "I need to earn some money to help me through my time at university."
- "A gap year means that you forget how to study and lose your enthusiasm to return to full-time education."
- "A gap year is just an excuse to have a good time."

Your article should be about 200 words long.

Taking a Gap Year Is a Smart Choice

Nowadays, many students choose to take a gap year before starting university. Some people argue it is a waste of time and may reduce students’ motivation to study, while others believe it is a great chance to relax, travel, or work. I believe taking a gap year can be very helpful if used wisely.

Firstly, a gap year provides students with the opportunity to explore the world.
For example, some students travel to different countries and experience new cultures.
This helps them become more mature, open-minded, and independent.
Therefore, by stepping out of their comfort zone, they grow into more responsible and thoughtful individuals.

Secondly, taking a gap year allows students to earn money and reduce financial stress.
Many students take part-time jobs during this period, saving up for tuition or living costs.
This teaches them time management and financial responsibility.
Thus, when they enter university, they are more prepared to handle adult life.

Lastly, a gap year helps students build a sense of social responsibility.
For instance, some students do volunteer work, such as helping in schools or charities.
These experiences develop their empathy and teamwork skills.
As a result, they not only benefit themselves but also contribute to society.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of taking a gap year. If planned well, it can help students become more independent, responsible, and socially aware, which prepares them better for university and future life.

I believe taking a gap year can be very beneficial if planned wisely.

Firstly, a gap year provides students with the opportunity to explore the world. Some students travel to different countries and experience different cultures.This helps them become more mature, open-minded, and independent. For example, Singapore is a multicultural country where people from different ethnic backgrounds live together. When visiting this country, students need to be careful with their words and actions.Therefore, by stepping out of their comfort zone, they grow into more responsible and thoughtful individuals.

Secondly, taking a gap year allows students to earn money and reduce financial stress. Many students take part-time jobs during this period, saving up for tuition or living costs.This teaches them practical skills such as budgeting and financial planning. As a result, when they enter university, they are better equipped to manage their finances and focus on studies without excess.

Lastly, a gap year helps students build a sense of social responsibility.
By stepping outside students' environments,students gain exposure to real-world issues and diverse communities..As a result, they not only benefit themselves but also contribute to society.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea of taking a gap year.A well-planned gap year equips students with independence, responsibility, and social awareness, which prepares them better for university and future life.
