## Hammarby Lake City
an environmentally friendly place to live

Hammarby Lake City is a housing development project in Sweden. It is located to the south-east of the capital city, Stockholm. The design of Hammarby includes a range of conservation measures, such as using energy more efficiently compared to the rest of Sweden. For example, Hammarby produces its own heating and electricity for residents to use by burning some of its household rubbish 1Ô∏è‚É£, and there is a very effective system in place to do this.

Another important part of the design is that rainwater is recycled. After it has rained, the water is saved and channelled into specially created small lakes and streams. These features in an urban environment help to make the neighbourhoods more attractive places to live, and they also provide a habitat for wildlife 2Ô∏è‚É£.

Hammarby is the first city for many years where a tram-line has been built to provide the main method of transport for commuters 3Ô∏è‚É£. Trams are far less polluting than trains or buses and certainly cars. Of course, some people in Hammarby still use cars, but they are encouraged to use a car-share system so that the number of private vehicles is reduced 4Ô∏è‚É£. For people trying to be even more eco-friendly, there‚Äôs a pedestrian and bicycle network 5Ô∏è‚É£, which makes it convenient and safe for residents to get around.

Although Hammarby was planned to provide houses for a large number of people on a fairly small site, there are lots of public green spaces for residents to enjoy 6Ô∏è‚É£. There are also several buildings which have roof gardens 7Ô∏è‚É£, and these help to cool the rooms below in high temperatures.

It is expected that there will eventually be 20,000 residents living in Hammarby in addition to 10,000 workers, and the design for the city has attracted interest from other countries who wish to build similar communities.

Fashion has always been a part of society, influencing how people express themselves and how they are perceived by others. However, some believe too much importance is placed on it. On the other hand, while some see fashion as a way to showcase individuality, others argue that trends can be stressful and unfair.

On one hand, fashion can boost confidence and help people feel accepted. It allows individuals to express their personality and creativity. On the other hand, it also creates pressure. Many feel they must wear fashionable clothes to fit in, which can be stressful and expensive. Instead of blindly following trends, people should spend time researching their own lifestyle and choosing fashion that makes them happy.

Another issue is the environmental impact of fast fashion. As trends change constantly, people are encouraged to discard clothes and buy new ones frequently. This harms the planet and promotes a culture of excess. Instead of chasing trends, people should focus on quality over quantity and develop their own unique style.

In summary, fashion is a personal choice, but it should not define a person. People should wear what suits them best and focus on being themselves. Confidence and comfort, both physically and mentally, are far more important than following fleeting trends.
