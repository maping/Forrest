The Importance of Digital Skills Over Handwriting‌
Nowadays, there is an ongoing debate about whether it is still necessary to teach children the skill of handwriting. Some people argue that handwriting is an important basic skill, while others believe that it is no longer useful in today's digital world. In my opinion, handwriting is no longer essential for students.

Firstly, digital literacy has become more important than handwriting. Children use computers, tablets and phones for studying, communication, and even exams. Learning to type quickly and efficiently helps them complete their tasks faster and prepares them for modern jobs that rely heavily on technology. Moreover, typing is more time-saving and convenient, allowing students to focus on improving their ideas rather than worrying about neat handwriting.

Secondly, handwriting lessons take up too much valuable class time. Instead of spending hours practicing writing, students could focus on more important subjects such as coding, digital research, or science, because these skills are more relevant to future careers and real-world challenges. Furthermore, by learning digital skills earlier, children can adapt and more easily to a fast-changing, technology-driven society.

In conclusion, although handwriting was once an essential skill, digital literacy is now far more practical. Schools should focus on preparing students for the digital age.
