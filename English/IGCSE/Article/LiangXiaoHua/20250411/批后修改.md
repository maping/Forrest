**TURNING NIGHT INTO DAY**

If humans were really comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would happily go around at night without any artificial light. We would be able to see the world in the same way as the many species that could in darkness are able to see it. The fact is that we are daytime creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sunlight.

In order to create a longer day, even extending to 24 hours, we have lit up the night. We have changed it to suit our purpose by filling the darkness with light. This kind of action disturbs human and natural life and comes with shadowing us well as benefits. By artificially increasing the amount of light in our world, we have produced light pollution.

Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design , which allows artificial light to shine outward and upwards into the sky, where it can be visible 1️⃣. Instead of focusing it downwards, where it is needed. Most of us live in town and suburbs, which suffer from much light coming from humans, offices, factories and roads 2️⃣. In these places, we are often unable to control the light in urban areas and private cities.

In most cities, the sky looks as though it has been emptied of stars. Many of us have grown up seeing nothing more than a hazy sky, and we have never enjoyed the wonderful sight of a clear night sky, full of beautiful stars.

Humans have artificially lit up the night assuming that it had no office on any living creature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The number of species that are busy in the darkness is astonishing. By increasing the amount of artificial light, we have completed and summer days creatures 3️⃣. Some birds now see a moment lower in the presence of artificial light. Sea turtles, which much prefer dark beaches to build their roots, find fewer and fewer suitable places.

Like most other creatures, we need darkness. It is as essential to our well-being as light itself. By reducing the amount of darkness each day, we are upsetting the regular things and rhythm of waking and sleeping 4️⃣. This means that we rarely get enough sleep at the right time.

It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who needed to see the night sky in all its glorious clarity. In fact, some of the earliest efforts to try and control light pollution, in Flagstaff, USA, were made to prepare for the mission in the Lowell Observatory, which might be city, in April, Flagstaff was destined for first International Dark Sky City, New, more and more cities and even whole countries have committed themselves to reducing unwanted artificial light.

Finally, we must not ignore the amount of energy that is wasted throughout the world as a result of our desire for extra light. It is arguable that, of all the different types of pollution, light pollution is perhaps the easiest to reduce. Simple designs in lighting design and installation produce immediate changes in the amount of light that in the atmosphere and, often, provide immediate energy savings.
