**TURNING NIGHT INTO DAY**

If humans were really comfortable under the light of the moon and stars, we would happily go around at night without any artificial light. We would be able to see the world in the same way as the many species that exist in darkness are able to see it. The fact is that we are daytime creatures, with eyes adapted to living in the sunlight.

In order to create a longer day, even extending to 24 hours, we have lit up the night. We have changed it to suit our purposes by filling the darkness with light. This kind of action disturbs human and natural life and comes with disadvantages as well as benefits. By artificially increasing the amount of light in our world, we have produced light pollution.

Light pollution is largely the result of bad lighting design, which allows artificial light to shine outwards and upwards into the sky, where it is not wanted, instead of focusing it downwards, where it is needed. Most of us live in towns and suburbs, which suffer from too much light coming from homes, offices, factories and roads. In these areas, we are often unable to control the light that invades our homes and private lives 1️⃣.

In most cities, the sky looks as though it has been emptied of stars. Many of us have grown up seeing nothing more than a hazy sky, and we have never enjoyed the wonderful sight of a clear night sky, full of beautiful stars 2️⃣.

Humans have selfishly lit up the night assuming that it had no effect on any living creature. Nothing could be further from the truth. The number of species that are busy in the darkness is astonishing. By increasing the amount of artificial light, we have confused and harmed many creatures 3️⃣. Some birds now sing at unnatural hours in the presence of artificial light. Sea turtles, which much prefer dark beaches to build their nests, find fewer and fewer suitable places.

Like most other creatures, we need darkness. It is as essential to our well-being as light itself. By reducing the amount of darkness each day, we are upsetting the regular timing and rhythm of waking and sleeping. This means that we rarely get enough sleep at the right time 4️⃣.

It was once thought that light pollution only affected astronomers, who needed to see the night sky in all its glorious clarity 5️⃣. In fact, some of the earliest efforts to try and control light pollution, in Flagstaff, USA, were made to protect the view from the Lowell Observatory, situated high above the city. In 2001, Flagstaff was declared the first International Dark Sky City. Now, more and more cities and even whole countries have committed themselves to reducing unwanted artificial light.

Finally, we must not ignore the amount of energy that is wasted throughout the world as a result of our desire for extra light. It is arguable that, of all the different types of pollution, light pollution is perhaps the easiest to reduce. Simple changes in lighting design and installation produce immediate changes in the amount of light lost in the atmosphere and, often, provide immediate energy savings 6️⃣.

## Summary 作业

## DeepSeek Summary 作业
Light pollution, caused by excessive artificial light, has several harmful effects. It obscures stars, preventing many people from experiencing a clear night sky. Wildlife is severely impacted, as artificial light disrupts the natural behaviors of nocturnal animals, such as birds singing at unnatural times and sea turtles struggling to find dark nesting sites. Humans also suffer, as reduced darkness disturbs sleep patterns, affecting well-being. Additionally, wasted energy from inefficient lighting contributes to unnecessary consumption. Although light pollution is among the easiest forms of pollution to address, poor lighting design continues to harm both the environment and human health.

(Word count: 110)

- Disruption of ecosystems – Nocturnal animals (e.g., birds, sea turtles) are confused by artificial light, affecting their survival.
- Human health impacts – Artificial light interferes with sleep cycles, leading to insomnia and fatigue.
- Energy waste – Excessive lighting increases unnecessary energy consumption and carbon emissions.
- Loss of star visibility – Urban skies are so bright that stars are no longer visible.
- Early misconception – Light pollution was initially seen as only an issue for astronomers.
- Easy solutions – Better lighting design (e.g., downward-facing lights) can reduce pollution and save energy.
