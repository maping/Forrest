conservation.

The school provides recycling bins throughout the campus, and students actively use them, helping to reduce waste that ends up in landfills. Events such as Earth Day and other environmental awareness campaigns organized by students further show their commitment to making a positive impact.

Additionally, many students go beyond the classroom by joining environmental clubs and participating in green projects, such as planting trees or advocating for reducing single-use plastics. Their involvement in these initiatives reflects their dedication to protecting the environment not only within the school but also in the wider community. By educating others and leading by example, ACS students are helping to inspire change.

In conclusion, the students at ACS International are clearly making efforts to save the environment. Through their involvement in various eco-friendly activities, they demonstrate a commitment to sustainability and a determination to protect the planet for future generations.
