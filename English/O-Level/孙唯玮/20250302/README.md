THE INVENTION OF The Printing Press
    
Dark & Middle Ages

Any writings and drawings had to be completed meticulously by hand. Such tasks were reserved for scribes who lived and worked in monasteries. They would work in silence, first outlining the layouts and then painstakingly copying the text from another book. Later, the illuminator would take over to supplement the pages with designs.

1300S - 1400S

A simple method of printing, which involved letters or images cut on blocks of wood, had been developed. These blocks would be dipped in ink and then stamped onto paper.

Late 1430S

A German man named Johann Gutenberg realised that if he could use cut blocks within a machine, he could make the printing process more efficient. Furthermore, he would be able to reproduce texts in larger quantities. However, instead of using wooden blocks, he used metal instead. This was the printing press, in which the metal block letters could be rearranged to create new words.

Initially, the noble classes despised the cheaper, mass-produced books. To them, hand-inked books were a symbol of luxury. Thus, printed materials were at first more popular with the lower classes. However, the printing business developed into a new trade as soon as words of the printing press spread.

Printed texts became a new way to spread information to vast audiences quickly and cheaply. This increased the discussion and development of new ideas. A revolution of communication is hence said to have taken place with the invention of the printing press.

Towards the 19th century

Other inventors created steam-powered printing presses that did not require a hand operator.

Today

Printing presses are electronic and automated, and can print much faster than before!

"Go on," said Jing Hui. "There's only one (52) **way** to know." Dino barked noisily and ran around their legs, waiting (53) **for** the fun to begin. As if by magic, the canine stopped 'playing' and moved stealthily to the side, waiting patiently for whatever drama was going to (54) **happen**.

"It's all right for you," said Marcos. "You're not going for the competition." Suddenly he ran towards the edge of the stone wall facing the waters and jumped. He plunged into mid air and flapped his arms furiously. Panic (55) **twisted** his face. He flapped (56) **even** harder. "No!" he yelled.

He plunged down, rolled (57) **over** in the sand and lay still. Jing Hui ran down to meet him. "Are you alright?" he hollered. Marcos lifted up a sandy face, spat out some granules of sand and nodded. He undid both (58) **wings** and very calmly and consciously left (59) **them** on the sand.

"It'll never work," said Jing Hui. "You'll never win the Flyboy competition like that. You can't jump off the (60) **edge** of a jetty in those. You'll just drop (61) **like** a deadweight. An awfully wet deadweight," Jing Hui unsuccessfully tried to stifle a giggle. Marcos looked down at the ground as if in (62) **defeat** but then an almost eerie winning grin formed on his lips.

"It doesn't (63) **matter**," said Marcos. "I'm going to pick up my Uncle Zohr's bang-glider this evening. A real one. You watch me fly over the waves (64) **once** I get that. This year my opponent Ray isn't going to win for once."

"My uncle's aerodynamic and lightweight 'flyer' will beat Ray's and anybody else's entry. Nobody will stand a (65) **chance**!"

  - 72 The whale was entangled in thick, strong nylon ropes called "blue steel," which were wrapped around its left pectoral fin, mouth, and head. The ropes had cut so deeply into its flesh that they were hidden in some areas. Its tail was also tightly bound by about twenty ropes, leaving it exhausted and struggling to keep its blowhole above water to breathe. Without help, it would have died from suffocation or severe injuries.
  - 73
    - The ropes had cut deeply into its flesh, with some lines even disappearing into its body, indicating severe wounds.
    - It had been struggling aggressively against the ropes earlier, which would have worsened the injuries and caused distress.

    - Unlike a panicked animal, it did not thrash or resist, suggesting it understood their actions were beneficial.

The two divers in snorkeling gear dropped backwards off the inflatable raft into the Pacific Ocean. Vigilantly, they swam towards the humpback whale lying exhausted in the waves. A huge flipper, about three metres long—the whale's left pectoral fin—rose up a metre away. One slap could kill a man.

Thick nylon ropes, called blue steel because of their strength, were wound around the fin, through the whale's mouth and over its head. In some parts, the lines sliced so deeply, they disappeared into the animal's flesh. Left like this, the whale would die.

Swimming downwards, the divers, Leon and Ken, saw the animal was a female, some 16 metres in length. Her tail was securely wrapped with about twenty ropes wound upwards and around her flipper. She was stuck fast—and using every ounce of energy to keep her blowhole above water.

Leon's heart sank as he looked at the tangled mess. There's no way we're going to save this whale, he thought, but he realised they had to try.

Using their dive knives, the two men started sawing at the 12-millimetre-thick blue rope. Instead of thrashing at them with her fin, the whale stopped moving entirely. Even after they cut her flipper free, she remained calm and still. I think she knows we're trying to help her, Leon thought.

The blue ropes still ran across the whale's head and through her mouth from side to side, like a gag. She had struggled so aggressively against the ropes earlier that they had cut into her flesh. Ken severed the ropes, then tugged with all his strength to remove the pieces. It was like pulling giant dental floss. This had to be terrifying for her, hurting her, but remarkably, she remained calm.

It was well after three hours after the rescuers arrived at the scene before Stan finally got down to the last few ropes. They were so deeply embedded in the blubber of the tail that he could not pry them loose. Not knowing how the animal would react, he shoved his knife in and began cutting. "I'm almost there," he muttered through his breathing apparatus. "Just two more ropes. I'll be done and you'll be released."

He made the final cut and surfaced with a shout of celebration. "Whoo-hoo! She's free!" Ken joined in the chorus. Finally liberated, the whale did a shallow dive. Leon turned around. "Where did she go?" he called out.

The next thing he knew, she was coming up from below and straight at him. Hey! I just saved you, he thought, relief turning to anxiety as she rushed at him. The humpback stopped thirty centimeters from his chest, nudged him, then turned and did the same to Ken. Then it swam in a circle around the divers. It swam with them for a good ten minutes.

Leon, who has had more than his share of adrenaline-inducing adventures, says, "I've spent twenty-six years in the military doing high-risk rescues, but nothing's more gratifying than this one. Nothing."
