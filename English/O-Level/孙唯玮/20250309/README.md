      - pretend 强调“表面宣称”，不要求逻辑严密的伪装设计，例如孩子假装自己是超级英雄（pretend to be a superhero）或学生临时谎称作业丢失，这类即兴、直接的假装行为。

It sits on a shelf at the top of my closet. Once it was a shoe-box, decorated for Valentine’s Day and given to me by my oldest child. This shoe-box valentine is (16) wrinkled and moldy where the jellybeans and gumdrops have run together. It is sticky in places but it is a repository of (17) objects from their childhood given to me by my children. They have (18) scrawled their names on little slips of papers - a product of love in its most uncomplicated and (19) authentic state.
﻿
The children are grown now. They still love me though it is harder sometimes to get any (20) information to prove it. Once in a while I take it down and open it. It is something I can touch and hold and believe in, now that there are no small arms around my neck.

On a lake in Western Siberia, flocks of ducks and geese (29) **are** roaming free.

There (32) **have** been bird flu outbreaks in dozens of Russian villages in the past month. The virus (33) **was** brought to Russia from Asia (34) **by** the migrating wild birds. Ornithologists in Russia say that wild fowl (35) **will** soon be moving on from here (36) **before** autumn comes. The most up-to-date research predicts some birds will head (37) **towards** the Mediterranean and Southern Europe. Other flocks will travel towards Germany, Britain and Ireland. It is likely that they could bear the bird flu virus (38) **with** them, potentially starting a bird flu pandemic.

South Korea is ranked together with some other countries as having the highest smoking rates in the world. This, combined with other risk factors, is leading to a steep (51) **rise** in heart disease. "Nearly a million Koreans now have heart disease," says cardiologist, Dr. Chae, at the Seoul National University Hospital.

Dr. Ortiz, ex-president of the Philippines Heart Association, says that owing to a (52) **lack** of exercise, excessive smoking, and a diet consisting primarily of fast food, heart disease has become his country's number-one (53) **killer**. "It is this combination of risk factors that is so deadly and is taking a (54) **toll** on the general population of this country. Moreover, this 'killer' affects people from all (55) **walks** of life. For example, three doctors, who were former medical school classmates, have also suffered massive heart attacks. They were in their early forties. Paramedics that attended to them (56) **performed** cardio-pulmonary resuscitation (CPR), but their resuscitation efforts failed."

Malaysian cardiologist, Dr. Abdul Latiff, says, "Ten years ago, heart disease among the young was unheard of, but today it is becoming a very (57) **common** phenomenon." Two years ago, Dr. Latiff raced to help a man wheeled in with serious chest pains. The man's life was (58) **hanging** on a thread. He was breathless, cold, and pale. Latiff's eyes darted towards a chart on the wall. (59) **Looking** at his heart-rate chart, Latiff exclaimed, "I cannot believe that this man is only 31 years old!"

The news is mostly bad. "Still," says Dr. Latiff, "the good news is this pandemic of heart disease is entirely preventable, but we must act fast before it is too (60) **late**."

Malaysia's Ministry of Health has (61) **set** up free screening programmes in rural hospital clinics. These clinics run tests that allow checks on patients' cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other risk factors. Those at (62) **risk** are identified and treated for their conditions. They are also given advice on how to stay hale and (63) **hearty**. Furthermore, they receive advice on how to lead a healthy lifestyle. Many people are referred to these programmes by their local doctors.

Dr. Zainal, an official with the Malaysian Ministry of Health, says, "We are taking our first baby (64) **step**, but it is making a difference."

In Singapore, heart disease is also one of the top three "lifestyle diseases" of a developed nation. The government has decided to focus on educating the young on the (65) **importance** of an active and healthy lifestyle.

    - No, the tap was not adequate for the people in the kampong. The text states that there was only one tap in a shared bathroom used by about a hundred people from all the houses in that line. Additionally, people had to queue to collect water for their kitchens, which implies that the single tap was insufficient to meet the needs of the entire community efficiently. The phrase "one can visualise the way the queue snaked from the single water source" further emphasizes the scarcity and inconvenience caused by the limited water supply.
    - Evidence:
      - "a shared bathroom, shared among about a hundred people in all"
      - "one tap in the bathroom"
      - "the queue snaked from the single water source"

The house which I remember from my days in the kampong had wooden walls and an atap roof, which was later replaced with zinc in the name of modernity, but in fact, the atap, though unsafe because of fire risk, was much cooler than zinc. The house was much like a hotel, because two families lived in the section I lived in. There were my uncles on my father’s side in one part with their families, and my family in the other, with grandmother.

There were limited amenities in the kampong. Each house had a separate kitchen, but a shared bathroom, shared among about a hundred people in all, for all the houses in that line. There was one tap in the bathroom, and a common washing area. We had to bring water from the tap for the kitchen. And one can visualise the way the queue snaked from the single water source. In total, there were some fifty houses around ours.

We had fruit trees around our house, and a very small garden. I was given my own tiny section. I planted flowers, roses and chrysanthemums, just as a pastime. I did not sell them, but gave them away, or brought them into the house for festivals. Before the outer kampong area became more developed, there were three ponds. We raised about fifty ducks. We also had a lot of chicken. We ate them as necessary.

The place was cool from the shade of the trees. There were banana, jackfruit and papaya trees. But it was not really very hygienic, because some farmers in the area reared pigs. They used to wander all over the place (I had a job keeping them out of our small garden). Perhaps my earliest memory of the place was the toilet. The pigs used to come under the toilet and wait for us. You could look through the floor boards and watch them with their snouts in the air, expectant. The people from our kampong were Chinese. But just across the canal was a Malay kampong. We did not mingle much with the Malays, not because they were Malays, but rather because it was the rival kampong.

In 1964, there were countless gang clashes between the two kampongs, which were frequently stopped by the curfew. I recall the times we were all ordered to go back home from school, half-way during the day. My parents put additional bars and locks at the windows, and the streets outside the kampong were deserted. My job was to prepare metal pails. These were for making a lot of noise to scare the attackers if our house was attacked. We were also equipped with whistles to call for assistance from the neighbours. It was a disturbing time. People spoke about a lot of clashes, but in reality I never witnessed any, and in spite of all our precautions our house was never attacked. In any case there only seemed to be trouble among the grown-ups.

I was in primary school at that time, and had been brought up speaking Malay. We still played with the Malays in the school and nothing was different. Some neighbours, however, moved out of the kampong at this time to live with relatives in town. We were carefree and played a lot with our neighbours' children. The kampong seemed like a charmed garden in those days, in spite of the filth around.
