Heart problems can be solved by sleeping on them! A lunchtime snooze (29) **may** be good for the heart. A Harvard study (30) **among** 23,681 healthy men and women, tracked for more (31) **than** six years, discovered that those (32) **who** took a midday nap for at least 30 minutes three times (33) **a** week were 37 percent less likely to die (34) **of** heart disease.

"The relationship (35) **between** stress and coronary mortality is well-established," (36) **says** a professor of epidemiology (37) **at** the Harvard School of Public Health. "We also know napping may (38) **be** a stress-releasing process."

Keith was sitting on a wooden bench in almost total darkness, smoking a cigarette, when he heard the snake. He heard it as a faint rustling noise and instantly (51) **held** his breath. When the sound (52) **became** more distinct, he knew the snake was crawling along the (53) **bench** he was sitting on.

He (54) **felt** the hairs on his neck stiffening as a cold sweat broke (55) **out** on his forehead. He resisted the temptation to draw hard on his cigarette and used its (56) **glow** to see the snake. As he listened, he realized that the snake was sliding unhurriedly towards him. A fresh rustle told him it was a (57) **mere** fifty centimeters away. Then he felt a slight tickling on his bare (58) **leg**. The snake was exploring his leg with its forked tongue. From its weight and the (59) **width** of its belly, Keith deduced that it was quite slender. It felt like eternity though it was perhaps just about a minute (60) **before** he felt the last centimeter of its tail slide off his skin.

He dared not move an (61) **inch**. He still had another (62) **problem** to solve—his cigarette. It had burnt down almost to the tip. How was he to get (63) **rid** of it? He could not (64) **put** it out without moving. If he did, the (65) **snake** would probably be equally aroused by the shower of sparks. Given its length, the reptile was not out of striking distance yet.

Jetsee stood before the rail which had been dismantled. He flung down his bundle of sticks. A train was due; not a freight but a passenger train. And he had nothing with which to stop it, no flag. He could not replace the rail and could not drive in the spikes with his bare hands. It was necessary to run, unquestionably necessary to run to the hut for some tools. "God help me!" he murmured.

Jetsee started racing towards his hut. He was out of breath, but still ran, tumbling every now and then. He had cleared the forest; he was only a few hundred feet from his hut, no more, when he heard the distant hooter of the factory sounding six o'clock! In two minutes' time, train no. 11 was due. "Oh Lord! Have pity on the innocent souls!" In his mind, Jetsee saw the engine strike against the loosened rail with its left wheel, shiver, career, tear up and splinter the sleepers—and just there, there was a curve and the embankment seventy feet high down which the engine would collapse—and the third-class carriages would be packed… little children… all sitting in the train now, never dreaming of danger. "Oh Lord! Tell me what to do! … No, it is impossible to run to the hut and get back in time."

Jetsee did not run on but turned back and ran faster than before. He ran as far as the rail which had been pulled up; his sticks were lying in a heap. He bent down, seized one without knowing why and ran on further. It seemed to him the train was already coming. He heard the distant whistle; he heard the quiet even tremor of the rails; but his strength was drained, he could run no further, and came to a standstill about six hundred feet from the dreadful spot. Then an idea came into his head, literally like a ray of light. Pulling off his cap, he took out of it a scarf, smoothed it out, tied it to the stick and hung out his red flag.

He stood waving his flag. The train was already in view. The driver would not see him - would come close up and a heavy train cannot pull up in six hundred feet. And the blood kept flowing. Jetsee pressed the sides of the wound together so as to close it but the bloodflow did not cease. Obviously, he had cut his arms very deep. His head commenced to swim, black spots began to dance before his eyes and then it became dark. There was a ringing in his ears. He could not see the train or hear its noise. Only one thought possessed him. "I shall not be able to keep standing up. I shall fall and drop the flag: the train will pass over me. Help me, O' Lord!" All turned black before him, his mind became a blank and he dropped the flag; but the bloodstained banner did not fall to the ground. A hand seized it and held it high to meet the oncoming train. The engineer saw it, shut the regulators and reversed steam. The train came to a halt. People jumped out of the carriages and gathered in a crowd. They saw a man lying unconscious on the footway drenched in blood and another man standing beside him with bloodstained rag on a stick. Paul looked around at all. Then lowering his head, he said, "Bind me. I tore up a rail."
