An orchestra is a group of musicians, playing instruments of diverse types and comprising almost (29) **any** number of people.

The ancient Egyptians probably had orchestras of a sort, (30) **as** there is verification of primitive stringed instruments and drums (31) which were used by musicians playing together. (32) **However**, they had no means of writing (33) **down** their music, so it must have been simply used as accompaniment (34) **to** dancing or story-telling.

On the other hand, the ancient Greek musicians (35) **had** scales and a form of musical notation. Tunes were composed by musicians playing jointly, and so they had a type of orchestra (36) **more** like the ones we know today.

In 16th century England, there were already orchestras which were (37) **even** more on par with modern ones. The first operas, performed in 17th century Italy, had singers accompanied by small orchestras of mixed musical instruments—though probably half (38) **were** viols, the ancestors of modern stringed instruments.

At four, American drummer Aaron Branson Jr. was already banging the drums at his musician father's jam sessions. "Or I'd be snoozing in guitar cases during the sessions," the 21-year-old drummer said in an (51) **interview** with a local reporter lately.

The California native was in (52) **town** to perform at the Singapore Drum Fest 2013 (53) **held** at the Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Centre. Billed as the first (54) **international** drum festival in Asia, it featured a drum performance that (55) **lasted** eight hours every day.

(56) **Besides** Branson, also slated to perform were other celebrated (57) **drummers** and homegrown percussionist Jimmy Lee. Nonetheless, Branson was indisputably one of the festival's major (58) **attractions**, performing with his trademark——blazing hand movements and foot speed.

He has been winning major (59) **awards** since he was a teenager and now excels at several musical genres——funk, rock, rhythm and blues as (60) **well** as jazz, and has (61) **collaborated** with musical greats like Billy Cobham, Sheila E. and Branford Marsalis. But for (62) **himself** who has achieved much at a young age, Branson seems unfazed by his (63) **fame**.

"It's great to travel the (64) **world** to perform. That's an excellent perk," he said. "Meeting (65) **fans** and checking out places like the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoological Gardens, now that's the real pleasure," he added. A musical titan he may be, but it is evident that this virtuoso is still young at heart.
