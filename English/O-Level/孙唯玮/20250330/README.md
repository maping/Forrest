An orchestra is a group of musicians, playing instruments of diverse types and comprising almost (29) **any** number of people.

The ancient Egyptians probably had orchestras of a sort, (30) **as** there is verification of primitive stringed instruments and drums (31) which were used by musicians playing together. (32) **However**, they had no means of writing (33) **down** their music, so it must have been simply used as accompaniment (34) **to** dancing or story-telling.

On the other hand, the ancient Greek musicians (35) **had** scales and a form of musical notation. Tunes were composed by musicians playing jointly, and so they had a type of orchestra (36) **more** like the ones we know today.

In 16th century England, there were already orchestras which were (37) **even** more on par with modern ones. The first operas, performed in 17th century Italy, had singers accompanied by small orchestras of mixed musical instruments—though probably half (38) **were** viols, the ancestors of modern stringed instruments.

At four, American drummer Aaron Branson Jr. was already banging the drums at his musician father's jam sessions. "Or I'd be snoozing in guitar cases during the sessions," the 21-year-old drummer said in an (51) **interview** with a local reporter lately.

The California native was in (52) **town** to perform at the Singapore Drum Fest 2013 (53) **held** at the Suntec International Convention and Exhibition Centre. Billed as the first (54) **international** drum festival in Asia, it featured a drum performance that (55) **lasted** eight hours every day.

(56) **Besides** Branson, also slated to perform were other celebrated (57) **drummers** and homegrown percussionist Jimmy Lee. Nonetheless, Branson was indisputably one of the festival's major (58) **attractions**, performing with his trademark——blazing hand movements and foot speed.

He has been winning major (59) **awards** since he was a teenager and now excels at several musical genres——funk, rock, rhythm and blues as (60) **well** as jazz, and has (61) **collaborated** with musical greats like Billy Cobham, Sheila E. and Branford Marsalis. But for (62) **himself** who has achieved much at a young age, Branson seems unfazed by his (63) **fame**.

"It's great to travel the (64) **world** to perform. That's an excellent perk," he said. "Meeting (65) **fans** and checking out places like the Night Safari at the Singapore Zoological Gardens, now that's the real pleasure," he added. A musical titan he may be, but it is evident that this virtuoso is still young at heart.

With snow whirling around him, Kenny drove two ice axes into the frozen mountain face. Slowly, he hauled himself another 25 centimetres. Beneath his spiked boots, a wall of ice and rock plunged almost four kilometres straight down. He still had about one kilometre to climb to the summit. Kenny was on a solo attempt to scale the world’s highest vertical rock wall. Many had perished on the 8,125 metre Nanga Parbat, thus it was known as the Killer Mountain.

Despite the cold, a warm monsoon wind was melting the ice. With snowslides coming down every few minutes, Kenny knew he could not sustain long and needed to find shelter. He reached a vertical ridge of snow and started hacking into it with his ice axe. Kenny dug out a hole half the size of a fridge. He fixed a safety line at the back of the cave and clipped it to his harness and folded his knees under his chin. At least for now, he was safe.

Kenny had sent radio calls pleading for help. At the base camp, two pilots, Keith and Khal, were deployed to rescue him. They realised that the situation was worse than what they had visualised. The ice face was virtually vertical. With the rotor blades of the helicopter jutting out 5.5 metres, how would they get near enough to even pass Kenny a rope? Besides, vibration from the blades could also cause some snow above Kenny to collapse. This would hit the rotors and the helicopter might crash into the mountain. Nevertheless, the pilots went ahead. There was a hook under the helicopter. A sling was looped over the hook and the other end was attached to a bag filled with stones to keep it steady in the turbulent air. Kenny’s only chance was to grab the sling, clip it with the short rope attached to his harness and then, cut the safety line anchoring him to the ice-wall.

The next morning, the pilots took off. Keith circled in and hovered about 12 metres above Kenny. From the cockpit, he saw Kenny swinging his ice axe wildly to catch the sling but it was nowhere near him. Keith eased closer. Even when Kenny leaned far out into space, he still could not grab the sling, as the bag of stones continued to swing outwards like a pendulum.

Taking over the controls, Keith flew the helicopter and stopped hazardously close to the rock face. The bag of stones smashed into the snow. Kenny grabbed the bag filled with stones and gripped it between his thighs. He clipped the hook of his harness over the helicopter’s sling line.

Now that Kenny was attached to the helicopter, he had to cut the safety line that anchored him to the ice-wall. But with his frozen fingers and the air from the rotor blades beating down on him, he dropped the knife. Fortunately, the safety line broke when Keith tilted the helicopter to prevent the blades from hitting the ice. Then they rose into the air.

Later, the helicopter hovered above the base camp and lowered Kenny gradually. Faint with relief, Kenny saw the ground rise to greet him. Weeping, he fell forward and buried his face in the grass.
