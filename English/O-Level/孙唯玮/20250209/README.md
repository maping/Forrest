In 373 B.C., historians recorded that animals, including rats, snakes and weasels, deserted (29) **the** Greek city of Helice in droves (30) **just** days before a major quake.

Accounts of related animal anticipation of earthquakes have surfaced across the centuries (31) **before**. Catfish moving violently, chickens (32) **however** stop laying eggs and bees parting their hive in anxiety have been reported. Countless pet owners claimed to have witnessed their cats and dogs acting inexplicably (33) **when** the ground shook - barking or whining (34) **for** no apparent reason. But exactly (35) **what** animals sense, if they feel anything at all, is a mystery.

Scientists have no way of knowing precisely when or where an earthquake will hit. One of the world’s most earthquake-prone countries is Japan, (36) **where** devastation has taken numerous lives and caused substantial damage to property. Researchers (37) **there** have long studied animals to use that sense as a prediction tool.

(38) **Although** there have been documented cases, a connection between a specific behaviour and the occurrence of a quake has never been made. In the 1970s, a few studies on animal prediction were conducted but nothing conclusive came out of it.

    - 当“while”用作转折连词时，它表示两个句子之间的对比或相反的情况。尽管有某种情况或事实，但另一方面却存在与之不同或相反的情况。
      - ‌While‌ we have made great progress in understanding the universe, there is still much we don't know.

    - while和but在表转折时确实存在一些不同，主要体现在逻辑关系、语气强度及适用场景上。
      - but作为并列连词，直接强调对立矛盾，连接两个语法对等的独立分句，形成前后句意的直接对立。
        - 例如：“She studied hard, but failed the exam.”（她学习很努力，但考试却失败了。）这里but凸显了前后内容的矛盾，转折语气较为直接强烈。
      - 而while作为从属连词，引导的是状语从句，主从句之间存在从属关系。它侧重对比或并存关系，同时可兼具时间或让步含义。
        - 例如：“While the design is innovative, the cost is too high.”（虽然设计很新颖，但成本太高了。）在这里，while隐含了“虽然”的让步含义，转折语气相对婉转含蓄。

A typical day at work for Thomas Peter includes taking a four-hour jog with 40 dogs, big and miniature, young and aged, and none of them on leashes. (51) **While** most of these dogs belong to him, the rest are troubled dogs sent to Peter to learn good behaviour. Evidently, Peter has an extraordinary gift (52) **for** working with these animals.

Growing up on a ranch in Mexico, Peter knew he (53) **had** to work with dogs. His first (54) **job** at age 15, was assisting a veterinarian. He was so proficient in calming nervous dogs and (55) **handling** all kinds of situations, people started calling him ‘the dog boy.’ Since then, he has built a rewarding career around his (56) **beloved** animal.

Observing dogs on the ranch where he grew up, Peter realised they need a lot of exercise to be calm. He explains his (57)**philosophy**, “Exercise and discipline first, and then affection!” He says a lot of people get it (58)**wrong** because they do not realise what dogs truly need. Peter does not just train dogs; he trains owners to understand that their pets (59)**need** rules. He has helped celebrities (60)**like** Oprah Winfrey and Will Smith and everyday people too.

At his Dog Psychology Centre in New York, Peter also works with dogs whose dangerous behaviour has (61)**prevented** them from finding homes. He (62)**trains** them to be affectionate, gentle pets. Viewers can really see the (63)**transformation** in dogs with troublesome behaviour on Peter’s TV show, The Dog Whisperer.

To find the ideal job, Peter (64)**advises** kids to do what they enjoy. Peter offers this advice, “You can always find a job. But I find that contentment comes when you follow your (65)**passion**. Success followed me because I was following my dream of being the best dog trainer in the world.”

    - Few prisoners had the courage to escape because the conditions were harsh, and the risk of being caught or dying from exposure in the mountains was high. Additionally, the prisoners were likely weakened and demoralized by their living conditions.
  - 72
    - Armin's main reason for escaping was his strong desire to see his family again.
  - 73
    - Armin's escape plan was to disguise himself as a guard and follow them as they went off duty. The difficulty he encountered was obtaining a guard's uniform.
  - 74
    - Armin flicked a paper pellet at the guard to provoke a reaction that would lead to his being placed in a cell, where he could then execute his plan to obtain a guard's uniform.
  - 75
    - The prisoners had to endure dire living conditions in the prison.
      - True
      - The passage mentions that the huts were barely big enough for more than forty people, indicating overcrowded and poor living conditions. 
    - Armin thought of a few plans to escape.
      - False
      - The passage only details one specific plan that Armin devised to escape.
    - Armin demonstrated resourcefulness and creativity in devising a weapon to attack the guard.
      - True
      - Armin made a catapult from pine twigs and the elastic sides of his boots, showing his resourcefulness and creativity.
  - 76
    - Armin needed to hurry because he had to escape before the camp was fully secured for the night. Any delay risked discovery of the unconscious guard or his own absence, jeopardizing his escape plan. 
  - 77
    - Armin wore a guard's uniform, which effectively disguised his appearance as a prisoner.
    - He spoke in his best German, mimicking the correct response ("All correct, sir") like the other guards, which helped him blend in without raising suspicion.

    - The sentence "It seemed too good to be true" means that Armin found his successful escape almost unbelievable because it was so perfect and unexpected. After enduring harsh conditions and planning meticulously, the ease with which he finally achieved freedom felt surreal and almost unrealistically fortunate.
 
The prison camp which the Nazis sent Armin Theotoro to was in the mountains of South Poland. A few wooden huts clung to the edge of the bleak hillside. Most of the prisoners were poles, but there were Hungarians and Missions too. Each hat held about a hundred and twenty - yet it was barely big enough for more than forty. Few had the energy or the courage to escape. Some of their prison mates had slipped out of the camp before. Those who were not apprehended and sent back died of exposure in the mountains. But Armin was determined to escape. He would sit around the hat, thinking of his family and staring at the few tattered photos of them. How he yearned to see them again!

He decided to wait till early spring, when the nights were not so bitter. Very prudently he laid his plans. There was only one way out - the way the guards went, through the gate and past the guard-house. His idea was to disguise himself as one of them and follow them as they went off duty. But how was he to get hold of the uniform?

One March day, during the morning inspection, he flicked a paper pellet at the guard. It stung him behind the ear and made him turn round. Within five minutes Armin was in a cell in 'the cooler'. For two days he stamped up and down, 'to keep himself warm. Twice a day a guard delivered food to him. On the third evening, the guard came as usual. When Armin heard the soft thud of his footsteps in the snow, he crouched down on the floor at the back of his tiny cell. He had a smooth round stone and a catapult in his hands. He had made the catapult from pine twigs and the elastic sides of his boots. In a while the guard would unlock the door, look inside and hand in the food.

Armin waited apprehensively. He heard the key grate in the rusty lock of the outside door of 'the cooler'. The hinges creaked open. Armin drew back the elastic. He heard the padlock on the door being unlocked. The guard had not seen Armin when the stone struck him in the middle of his forehead and knocked him down. The floor trembled as he tumbled. A few moments later Armin was kneeling beside the unconscious man, hurriedly stripping off the uniform. There was no time to lose. Already the locking up of the prisoners had started and he could hear the guards shouting at them outside.

Armin felt warm and comfortable in the guard's uniform. Turning up the coller so that the tips touched his cheek-bones, he went out into the night. He hid behind the hat until the trumpet sounded like change of guard. Hundreds of times he had watch the guards fall in and march out of camp. It seemed to him quite natural now to be lining up with the others. The officer walked up to each guard.

"Anything to report?" the officer asked each of them in turn.

"All correct, sir," they answered.

"All correct, sir," said Armin in his best German.

"Guard, dismissal" said the officer.

Armin dropped to the rear and followed the other soldiers out - out of the great spiked gate and into freedom. It seemed too good to be true.
