Since at least the Middle Ages, wedding clothes have consisted of the finest clothes that a bride and groom could afford to mark the occasion (29) **of** their nuptials. These clothes (30) **may** have been made exclusively for them, or purchased ready-made, or hired for the occasion. Until the nineteenth century, the clothes of both the bride and groom were often coloured. Being a popular colour in early nineteenth-century women's fashions, white became a natural choice (31) **for** many brides. Progressively, the custom of a "white wedding" evolved (32) **until** the association of a white wedding dress with a virgin bride was firmly established in the minds of many. In the nineteenth century, brides in mourning selected colours to reflect (33) **their** bereavement.

Practical considerations also influenced the choice of wedding clothes. In the early nineteenth century, a bride (34) **would** appear at subsequent social functions in her wedding finery so the wedding gown was often styled as an evening dress. Later in the century, when afternoon dresses (35) **were** worn for the ceremony, a second dress - with a bodice appropriate for evening wear - was sometimes made. Less prosperous brides often chose coloured wedding dresses which could double (36) **up** as "best dress". Meanwhile, women in the highest social circles (37) **must** ensure their wedding dresses were proper for the post-nuptial court presentation. For brides in the later twentieth century, long wedding dresses have become a fantasy garment, replete with symbolic associations and far removed (38) **from** everyday dress. As such, they are intended to be worn once only.

He turned and left the room. After walking the streets of Denver for the entire night, he arrived (51) **home** just after sunrise. As he passed (52) **through** the library, he saw the portrait that Rasol Thallward had (53) **painted** of him. He gaped at it in surprise (54) **and** walked on into his bedroom. He (55) **took** his coat off and stood (56) **next** to his bed. A few moments later, he returned to the (57) **portrait** and looked at it closely. In the faint light, the face (58) **seemed** to have transformed a little. Now, the mouth looked malevolent. It was unquestionably bizarre.

He walked to the (59) **window** and opened the curtains. The light changed the room (60) **but** the face stayed the same. In fact, the sunlight made the mouth look even (61) **worse**.

Going back (62) **to** his bedroom, he discovered a small mirror that had been a (63) **gift** from Lord Henry. He looked at his real face and saw no sign of cruelty. What did it signify?

He threw himself into a (64) **chair** and began to ponder. Suddenly he (65) **remembered** what he had said in Rasol Thallward’s house the day the picture had been completed. He had asked for the painting to grow old so that he himself could remain young.

- P170-172

We were six teenagers on a week-long service mission to restore the homes of the less privileged living in the Appalachian mountains. The area appeared to contradict itself, for it held so much magnificence yet housed so much poverty. Perhaps we hailed ourselves as being able to serve those in need; I do not think we ever conjured up what we could benefit from it would perhaps be more valuable than any services we could render.

Our white van meandered through the broken West Virginia landscape and pulled up alongside John’s avocado-coloured house. As the doors opened, we poured out with hammers in hand, prepared to start our routine. We interchanged jobs as we basked in the southern sun; some of us scraped and painted windows, while others stained the deck or mended the roof. All the while, John, a retiree, sat in a lawn chair observing us – the kindest of old men, only too apologetic that he could not toil alongside with us on the ladders. We passed the time with private jokes and songs, truly enjoying ourselves despite the monotony of painting window after window as John just silently observed with a cane in hand to support himself in case he needed to get up.

As the clock neared noon, we took our lunch break in the shelter of a small tree in John’s front yard. Sam, our moderator, planted John’s chair beside us and announced that since he was keen to assist in any way possible, John would lead us in a before-meal prayer. He saw our weary faces and heard the growls from our stomachs. He kept it succinct and we started digging into our food.

“Let me tell you a story…,” he then began. From the pit of his modest heart, he began to unravel his eighty-some-odd years for us. He was a school teacher who had a dog named Pretty-Face. He told of old hunting expeditions in the mountains where his life was almost lost to a bear, and he talked of subduing a rattlesnake, even showing us the rattles.

Then his cavernous eyes just wandered off as if he was no longer talking for our benefit, but more for his own. He described that day his dog died, as fat tears rolled down his weathered cheeks and he clasped the end of his cane. He recalled her faithfulness to the end as with one last thump of the tail, looking up at him, Pretty-Face passed on. He remembered his wife gazing up at him much the same way seconds before her demise.

He always tenderly called his wife ‘Mama’, and he told of how she had always stayed up until the wee hours of the morning to bake the bread for the next day while he, often exhausted from a long day of teaching or hunting, would retire to bed. “Why hadn’t I taken the extra time to stay up with her?” he said in a distant voice as his eyes gazed beyond us. “Why couldn’t I do so? Why?”

I remembered how intensely those words rang inside of me. Here was a man brimming with wisdom and reflections on his life, telling me to make the most of mine, to take the extra time with those I love. I was motivated; I was mesmerised by this amazing old man whom I had thought I was helping. John’s house was not a workplace at all; it was a classroom.
